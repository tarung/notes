00:00 foreign
00:03 [Music]
00:20 looking at the
00:22 what is the important which are the ones
00:24 that are selling the most get of the
00:26 revenue sales trying to look at together
00:27 and so on I think they're done
00:29 what remains to be done is uh trending
00:33 right yes you wanted to see uh actually
00:36 the planning planning head to head that
00:38 question I had that question right uh
00:40 can we see the sales by day can we see
00:41 the sales something like that right
00:43 correct
00:44 um
00:45 so so let's try and do that let's try
00:49 and see uh let's say how volume strength
00:53 we want to see the volume Trend by by
00:55 date you can look at first we look at my
00:59 date then we'll look at by date day
01:01 we'll see yeah that should be more
01:02 interesting that will be more
01:03 interesting so first let's look at my
01:05 date Dave is basically you're seeing
01:06 whether there is correspondence between
01:08 the Monday of this week and Monday or
01:09 the next right so if there is a pattern
01:11 that comes because of the weekend but
01:12 later no let's just first 15 days 15 day
01:16 chart so uh what do we do right so again
01:20 we go same problem same problem right
01:22 same problem is that we have given by
01:25 this data has give has been given by
01:27 CTE and all that correct so now we will
01:30 just do our standard pivot table
01:32 we will insert a pivot table
01:35 and in that pivot table we will take
01:38 data from
01:41 column instead of adding by SK you want
01:43 to add by date correct that's all I want
01:45 to do ah
01:48 lovely that will be nice right yeah yeah
01:50 let's do that
01:52 let's add do a pivot table where the
01:55 rows are
01:56 date yes
01:58 huh rows are dead
02:03 let me make it a little larger
02:06 okay so we will say rows are dead rows
02:09 are dead and valuable
02:13 computers sale sale by some some of
02:16 sales sum of sales okay yeah and now
02:20 just this blank value has come so let me
02:22 just remove the blank value
02:25 very good at the Blackberry because I've
02:27 selected the entire column okay
02:30 okay
02:31 so now if I take it's recommend us I
02:33 should recommend something let's see
02:34 let's see what graph it recommends
02:51 so let's say insert recommended graph
02:56 so one this uh do you want to do it like
02:60 this or do you want to do it like this
03:01 line is better cleaner Yeah clean okay
03:05 line is better
03:06 yeah okay you remove it yeah you don't
03:09 need to remove this Legend yes
03:20 yes
03:30 yeah
03:31 no what is this do you say anything
03:34 uh it seems to I mean I would have
03:37 thought okay so it's not keeping on
03:39 going on of course in 15 days it's not
03:40 keep going I'm getting
03:42 but even trendwise itself you're just
03:44 going a little bit up and down but no
03:46 clear Trends right no time no Trend no
03:49 trend
03:50 uh should we do the same thing by
03:53 Revenue
03:54 ah that might be interesting let us see
03:56 yeah let's see the revenue so let's
03:58 repeat this exercise
04:01 where is the sales data
04:07 and let me insert
04:10 your table from
04:35 increase the size
04:43 again date is a row date is the row
04:46 and revenue is the radius sum of Revenue
04:50 is the value okay and this let me
04:54 format as
04:56 currency it won't remember no it won't
05:02 yeah
05:04 okay
05:05 remove the black remove the black
05:17 okay
05:18 okay and now
05:26 we can try inserting a
05:30 chart
05:32 and again let's do it as a line right
05:34 yeah because the correct line chart
05:39 you can remove the total thing
05:42 and again I don't see no Trend no any
05:45 major Trend right yeah I guess 15 days
05:47 is not is not enough yeah yeah what
05:51 trend you will see in this okay
05:53 slightly going up and down around some
05:54 hours that's all yeah yeah but you can
05:56 see that they are doing 25 to 30 lakhs
06:01 roughly in that type of thing per day
06:03 yes yes huh yes
06:06 yes 25 to 30 lakhs after a day per day
06:10 good huh yeah yeah it's a lot of money
06:12 it's a lot of money so if you look at it
06:15 as uh you know seven and a half crores a
06:17 month oh yeah right okay so and this is
06:21 only for 30 skills this is only for 30
06:23 skus they would typically have I don't
06:26 know tens of thousands of thousands
06:29 so you can change the title to revenue
06:31 trend
06:33 so that you can share it with
06:38 the sum of Revenue come here
06:44 wait let me be I think that's just a
06:46 legend okay it's all right
06:49 we'll call it
06:51 Revenue
06:53 tricked OK yeah
06:57 now what may be more interesting GV
06:60 perhaps we should look at is what you
07:03 were saying in terms of day
07:05 day which means Monday
07:08 Tuesday Wednesday Monday correct one
07:10 chart then Monday next week another I
07:12 mean another
07:13 no so we will do this graph very similar
07:17 to this
07:18 except instead of having dates on the uh
07:24 uh x axis x axis we will have days on
07:28 the X but then you'll add up Monday and
07:30 Monday yeah
07:32 yeah that's okay so we want to see which
07:34 day of the week is giving us ad Monday
07:37 of this week and Monday of next week
07:38 together okay all right yeah okay yeah
07:41 let's do that
07:43 so
07:44 for that first thing I have to do is the
07:46 sales Master
07:48 or the sales data I will have to add
07:52 a new column called day day of the week
07:56 without the furniture
07:59 so we can actually find that out from
08:02 the date
08:04 there's a function to do there yes so
08:06 what we can say is text
08:09 so we want to convert this date
08:12 into text okay so instead of doing this
08:15 we will say
08:16 text
08:18 A2
08:21 comma
08:23 and the format we want it is is d d d
08:34 basically means d
08:37 Ford is your gear yeah
08:39 okay okay
08:41 so now if you go down
08:43 yeah because
08:47 oh okay okay so it's going to Friday
08:50 when the date changes yeah
08:56 yeah I just wanted to check yeah okay
08:59 okay yeah so let's just see just are
09:02 there other days Sunday or not is there
09:06 30 that's because 15 days we are
09:09 checking
09:10 Wednesday
09:12 okay all right it's fine it's okay okay
09:14 [Music]
09:17 now
09:21 let's go to now you'll some by Thursday
09:23 again paper table insert a pivot table
09:25 with G as the a you will make the yes
09:28 you want to make G as the row correct I
09:31 know correct okay okay and the thing is
09:34 now what I will do is until now I used
09:36 to consistently pick up till column
09:38 G
09:46 so that the day also shows up yeah okay
09:48 now I'll just one second before I do
09:51 that let me
09:54 increase it to
10:00 right so we will take day
10:05 and uh what shall we do you want to look
10:07 at volumes you want to let's first look
10:09 at volume volumes yeah yeah
10:15 so interesting
10:18 sales actually seem high on Tuesday
10:21 Wednesday Thursday
10:23 and lower on weekends
10:28 we don't will ask maybe there's a reason
10:30 for this we don't know isn't it it does
10:32 the volume at least yeah
10:35 okay let's
10:37 we should go back to omkara
10:40 that's it I guess that's the difference
10:42 between no you know what
10:43 maybe that's the difference between
10:44 e-commerce and real life maybe on
10:47 weekends people go to the malls
10:49 and on weekdays they shop from home
10:51 yeah they're saying at least possibly
10:54 possibly but Sunday there is a little
10:56 bit of a spike maybe Sunday evening
10:58 people are just sitting here yeah yeah
11:00 something like that possible we don't
11:03 know but Tuesday to Wednesday Thursday
11:05 seems to be the Thursday really seems to
11:08 be a year today they finish the shopping
11:09 come back it's low it's low everywhere I
11:11 think it's low everywhere correct it's
11:12 an iterative that's why I think so
11:14 Thursday actually this is probably a
11:16 little bit of an artifact because in our
11:17 data there were three Thursdays so we
11:19 can ignore this
11:21 ah see there were only two Mondays two
11:24 Tuesdays but there were three Thursdays
11:26 because we got data from first of April
11:28 to 15th of April
11:30 so there were three Thursdays
11:33 oh okay that is the reason that's the
11:34 reason so Thursday we can ignore her but
11:36 Tuesday and Wednesday there definitely
11:39 seems to be a little bit of a bump up
11:41 yeah yeah
11:43 but anyway let's plot this and show this
11:46 to omkar
11:48 um
11:53 and again we'll insert a chart
11:57 and how do you want to do it
11:59 yeah that's good for this
12:03 okay yeah so I will remove this
12:11 this is
12:14 volume
12:17 trend
12:19 by D
12:24 yeah okay okay the same thing I will do
12:27 maybe
12:29 30 seconds
12:45 it's a pivot table
12:51 from
12:53 sales data dollar a to
12:57 dollar G
13:04 and then I will take day here or I
13:08 should increase the
13:16 should I take day here remove the blanks
13:27 and then get Revenue here
13:30 right
13:32 again let me format this as currency
13:36 unfortunately it doesn't remember that
13:38 this started office currency so it
13:41 should come out as currency
13:55 okay that's right watch out
13:57 yeah nice
14:03 and this is
14:05 Revenue
14:08 trend by
14:13 again not any significant nothing
14:15 significant yeah yeah
14:19 anyway Let's Go and show yeah yeah this
14:22 I'll remove this
14:24 okay yep
14:27 okay so okay this is Trend analysis yes
14:31 we didn't learn much but yeah yeah
14:33 I guess we had more data we could have
14:35 done something correct no correct
14:37 possibly yeah okay yeah except this
14:39 inside that maybe people e-commerce they
14:42 do in the video yes
