00:00 [Music]
00:15 so yeah okay
00:16 i think this revenue looks uh better but
00:19 can we see both of them together
00:21 probably after we look at them together
00:23 we'll be able to answer the question
00:25 which was asked uh about how do i
00:27 organize the fc
00:29 right let's see if if if we can load
00:32 them together on one graph is it
00:33 possible
00:35 you can't do a parallel with pareto you
00:38 need only one axis so difficult to do
00:41 two dimensional
00:42 i guess you can do something you need a
00:44 three-dimensional picture or something
00:46 but uh
00:48 when if you want to try a scatter plot
00:51 type of thing maybe we have done that we
00:53 did that scatter plotting of
00:56 volume on one axis
01:03 but at least it gives you a distribution
01:05 of the
01:06 things on yes
01:07 yes i think that that should that should
01:09 i should
01:11 okay
01:12 okay okay let's look at let's look at
01:15 the
01:16 scatter
01:19 so
01:20 again
01:21 uh this is what we did we basically
01:24 looked at the
01:26 the sum of the volume
01:28 and the sum of the revenue
01:30 for the 30 skus
01:33 yes and
01:35 then what we what we've done is we've
01:37 plotted the revenue on the y-axis and
01:40 the volume on the x-axis
01:42 okay
01:43 uh so the blue dots are basically
01:47 skus
01:48 yeah the orange plots are the lifestyle
01:51 skus and the gray dots of the
01:56 yes this looks interesting but i think
01:58 there is something which is happening
01:59 here uh all
02:02 barring the three of the
02:04 highest uh volume skus right one from
02:07 each vo
02:09 right is getting aggregated in one
02:11 corner of the graph itself so
02:13 maybe
02:18 we have a scale
02:19 we have a scale problem because one item
02:21 in each of these squares is
02:23 excuse the scale quite dramatically
02:25 right yeah outlets
02:30 how it looks
02:32 can we do that
02:34 the outlier so do we want to remove the
02:37 outlier and
02:38 examine what is remaining i mean does it
02:41 make sense okay
02:42 yeah okay okay
02:44 let let me let me do that and come back
02:48 so uh this is what i did uh
02:51 jv and um i removed
02:54 the top uh
02:56 top setting skus in each of the
03:00 each of the business lines
03:02 and now actually a little bit better
03:04 spread i think yeah this looks much much
03:07 more evenly sprayed
03:09 let's uh i think this is more useful for
03:12 uh answering the question which was
03:13 asked to us by
03:15 mr shastri right uh he wanted to
03:17 organize as uh fc in the best possible
03:20 way so let's say
03:22 draw a couple of lines let's just start
03:24 with a vertical line between let's say
03:26 somewhere between 200 and 300 volume
03:29 this will definitely
03:31 be
03:33 which are moving fast right let's say
03:35 anything about 250 is what we'll call a
03:37 fast moving sq these are the sql so
03:41 let's draw it here
03:43 yeah yeah yeah that should be good
03:47 something like this yes
03:49 so ideally okay it is a fast mover so i
03:52 should store this
03:54 as close to the dock as close to the
03:57 processing area as possible within my fc
03:59 right so i can offer
04:01 better speed i'll have much lesser
04:03 efforts for picking so that's a very
04:05 good card
04:06 but um
04:08 look at it i can see a clear cut
04:10 differentiation between the skews let's
04:12 say which are about um i think one thing
04:15 will help if you put commas there
04:18 but okay if i draw a horizontal line
04:20 also somewhere between 10 and 20
04:23 then that will give me i think all of
04:25 them are mobiles right up there
04:28 yes that it does seem like that
04:30 yeah so all of them are actually high
04:32 value items right so i need the special
04:35 type of storage i need to keep them in
04:37 lock and key or a caged pallet or
04:39 something which which will give me more
04:41 security in terms of their storage
04:44 right
04:45 yes yeah once on the right needs a
04:47 secure storage near dock but but once on
04:50 left we'll need probably secured store
04:52 but it can be anywhere if it happens to
04:54 be close and fine right but which are uh
04:58 once on left but bottom corner the
05:00 fourth quadrant that we have third
05:01 quadrant that we have
05:03 um they can be scattered anywhere what
05:06 are you going too fast for me
05:08 just let's go slowly so what you're
05:10 saying is that i've drawn a vertical
05:11 line around that 250 line right yeah now
05:15 what are you saying the ones the skus
05:17 which lie to the right of the line are
05:19 high volume escapes that's right
05:21 so what did you say we should do for
05:23 them so ideally they should be close to
05:25 the processing area they should be
05:27 closer to the
05:29 customer
05:31 no within fc i'll store multiple uh sqs
05:35 everywhere right okay
05:37 now the fast movers if i store closer to
05:39 processing area processing areas where i
05:42 pick and pack and dispatch to customer
05:45 oh there's something else called
05:46 processing
05:48 yes so
05:49 so when you order right
05:52 naked mobile phone i will not dispatch
05:53 that to customer right i'll put it in a
05:55 box i'll put some you will put it in the
05:57 box and all that yeah okay i'll put some
05:59 bubble wrap around it put it in the bag
06:01 let it go all right customer right
06:04 that is the packing area
06:06 where is usually where is that so if you
06:08 say terminal earlier there will be one
06:09 in there
06:09 no no each fc will have it each each c
06:12 will have it has a storage zone and
06:14 there is a processing zone processing
06:16 area
06:17 so inside oh i understand so inside the
06:20 fc you're saying yes you will store
06:22 these skus
06:24 closer to the place where the packing is
06:25 going on correct you know which is the
06:28 best fc i can give you example about
06:30 ah
06:31 is your kitchen
06:39 food storage there is a raw material
06:41 storage right oh
06:43 right there will be nice
06:46 something nearby everything right but
06:48 the processing area is where your
06:50 platform is processing area is where
06:52 your stoves are
06:54 right
06:55 like that so you're saying that tracking
06:57 is being done inside the fc yeah i need
07:00 to store
07:05 those sku's
07:07 which are moving in very high volume you
07:09 want to keep them closer to your uh
07:12 where they do the packing correct so
07:14 what is close to your stove is your salt
07:16 and uh your uh right tata and stuff
07:19 right yeah yeah yeah yeah the closest to
07:21 the uh
07:23 correct because that is used most often
07:26 right
07:27 so this vertical line has helped us to
07:28 understand how to organize the sku's
07:31 inside the fce inside the fc yeah the
07:34 ones to the right will be closer to
07:35 packing area and the ones to the left
07:36 will be swollen here correct
07:40 yeah now you draw another line didn't
07:42 matter i was talking another
07:56 precious costly
07:59 okay right or they need special storage
08:02 essentially right for example
08:04 even if i use cheese every single day in
08:07 my sandwich i will not keep cheese next
08:09 to my stove
08:10 right
08:11 i still keep it in refrigerator right
08:13 now yeah
08:14 it's a lock-in key
08:16 for for that matter mobile
08:19 however small cost or however big it is
08:23 and still keep it in the area which is
08:24 secure which is locked in your area
08:26 because even if a single mobile is lost
08:29 it's a huge financial loss to me right
08:32 right so high value items things which
08:34 is generating a lot of revenue
08:37 you want to put those skus in a secured
08:40 zone in a secured place
08:42 correct
08:43 so
08:44 it may not be close to the packing area
08:45 actually
08:47 may happen to be close to packing area
08:49 may be close to the tracking we don't it
08:51 will be dictated by okay so if i look at
08:53 the grid again let's say there is
08:54 quadrant one two three four
08:56 right quadrant one i'll be secure but
08:59 anywhere
09:03 some text
09:04 yeah that is yeah we need abcd or some
09:07 something like that so that we can refer
09:08 to that
09:09 so i will call this
09:12 a
09:13 okay
09:15 i will call this
09:20 b maybe
09:21 yeah
09:23 and call this
09:29 p
09:31 all right
09:32 and i will call
09:34 this
09:36 b
09:37 okay
09:38 okay let's talk these quadrants now now
09:40 we already said something about b and c
09:42 together that will be close to packing
09:44 area yeah yeah so b is that something
09:46 about a and b together secure area
09:48 no a and b is secured area b and c
09:50 closer to packing area all right it
09:52 happens to be the stepchild that can be
09:54 anywhere
09:57 b can be anywhere yeah b we don't care
10:03 uh maybe
10:05 just need to move c little bit i think
10:06 it's not coming clear where where the
10:08 currents are
10:11 yeah this is better
10:14 okay now uh
10:16 now umkar do you want to explain what is
10:18 abcd yes we will do that again
10:23 all right so now that we have drawn the
10:25 lines let's name this quadrants abcd so
10:28 that we can refer to them now let's look
10:30 at this so
10:32 the skews which fall on the right side
10:35 of vertical line which are in quadrant b
10:37 and c
10:38 are all the skews which are moving
10:40 faster right
10:42 so if i store them within within a
10:45 fulfillment center i like to store them
10:48 close to processing area now if you want
10:50 to ask what is processing area
10:52 essentially that is the process that is
10:53 the area
10:55 where your order will be packed it will
10:57 be bubble trapped and packed in a box or
10:59 a or a polythene bag and it will be
11:02 dispatched for your destination right
11:05 so the fc will be divided into two parts
11:07 one is which is storage area one which
11:09 is processing area
11:11 now
11:12 orders which are faster need to be close
11:14 to processing area however if i look
11:17 high value items let's say whatever is
11:19 above the horizontal line
11:21 all these items are high value items you
11:23 are talking about uh maybe
11:25 15 000 plus
11:27 cost for a single item so i don't want
11:28 to use them
11:30 right so ideally what i would like to do
11:32 is i'd like to put them in a secured
11:33 storage now secured
11:36 could be a mirror with a lock and key or
11:38 it could be a cage pallet it could be
11:39 any form of
11:40 security
11:42 however i would like to keep them safe
11:46 hence if i want to organize the fc which
11:48 mr shasti was asking
11:50 i'll rather keep items in quadrant c
11:54 very close to
11:55 dock very close to processing area
11:60 items in quadrant b very close to
12:02 processing area again but in a secured
12:04 storage
12:05 quadrant a i like to keep them secured
12:07 but it could be anywhere in fc and items
12:10 in d will be literally near fc in fc
12:13 wherever i have space now
12:15 i cannot keep constraint for all so that
12:17 these are are the fillers they can form
12:19 anywhere they can fit anywhere so this
12:22 is typically how i organize my fc so
12:25 that my cost of picking
12:27 is least so that the person will not
12:29 have to travel all the way in the depth
12:31 of fc to pick up something which is
12:33 required more frequently
12:35 and i don't want many people to move
12:36 around that that
12:39 area again and again
12:40 and hence i i organize my fulfillment
12:43 center in this way so that i get maximum
12:46 cost efficiency from picking perspective
12:48 which i'll pass on to my customers for
12:50 best price
12:53 it's very interesting i think
12:54 yeah this is i mean we didn't expect
12:56 that we will generate so much insight
12:58 from the scatter plot but it's nice very
13:00 nice
13:02 something very important
13:05 that's the story part
13:06 why yeah
13:08 that's the content of the day if they
13:09 don't
13:10 imply something on ground doing data
13:12 analysis of know yours no use yeah
13:15 [Music]
13:17 so omkar you also said something that
13:19 struck me you said always put commas in
13:22 these numbers yes absolutely that
13:24 readability is very important i keep on
13:27 saying this software happen my
13:30 consultant in me always
13:33 bothers
13:35 myself about it
13:36 i just use currency
13:38 wherever your data is there just use
13:40 currency format
13:42 uh yes i will just make this so i
13:46 take this and
13:49 uh you don't need to change it here just
13:51 go to the source data
13:53 okay okay
13:57 and uh this is our so yeah
13:59 yeah yeah
14:00 here just this and make a general
14:04 currency with zero decimals
14:08 i don't know oh i thought so
14:12 currency is coming with ruby symbol but
14:14 i that that's fine that should be okay
14:16 that's okay
14:18 and this i will now
14:21 take this and i will paint this
14:23 here
14:24 as well as here
14:26 yeah
14:28 okay
14:31 [Music]
14:38 uh readability right i can see
14:40 immediately its number is one crore
14:45 right
14:47 so
14:48 otherwise i'll have to stop and count
14:50 zeros and counting zeros is not easy
14:54 you make mistakes
14:55 more than that you make mistakes yes
14:58 yeah
