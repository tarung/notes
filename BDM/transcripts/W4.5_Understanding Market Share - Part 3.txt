00:00 foreign
00:04 [Music]
00:15 data
00:20 so this is the idea here was that we
00:23 have been
00:24 looking at the data from the consumption
00:27 side
00:28 we need to also pay some attention to
00:31 the
00:31 production side right so in this case
00:34 we're talking about loans correct guys
00:36 are producing our
00:37 uh either Banks public or private Banks
00:40 or this non-backing financial companies
00:42 so they are the ones who are writing the
00:44 loans right that is correct and so we
00:46 said can we get data about
00:48 loans that are getting originated and
00:50 you know we got access to some data it's
00:52 in the tech I think it is synthetic it
00:54 is now unfortunately that data set also
00:57 had some names of companies companies so
00:60 we have to be I mean since it's
01:02 synthetic data it may not really
01:03 accurately reflect yeah to some extent
01:05 it does but it cannot accurately reflect
01:06 because it was backward work back from a
01:09 report sure so in a sense
01:12 um since it's work back from a reported
01:14 eventually it kind of
01:20 so just to be safe
01:23 um you know we should not use the names
01:25 of companies in the analysis yeah I
01:28 think that's fair so in today's uh
01:31 lecture going forward in these lectures
01:32 we'll basically just replace the private
01:37 bank with just a keyword called private
01:38 bank it's a 10 this is this thing the
01:41 public sector bank with just public PSU
01:43 Bank yes and in BFC with NBS so that
01:47 category names we know right anybody who
01:49 wants to relate to the actual names can
01:51 go back to the previous lecture and look
01:52 at it if they want but this would be
01:54 then neutral to any actual party in the
01:57 ground because we're going to do more
01:58 Deep dive sure and since the synthetic
02:00 data I don't think correct the Deep dive
02:03 may not actually reflect reality yes
02:04 right yesterday it might have refrained
02:06 a little bit Yeah but this may not
02:07 reflect so correct okay
02:09 so
02:10 um
02:11 uh with that
02:14 disclaimer on the data set
02:18 can we take a second look at the data
02:22 and ask a few more questions sure huh so
02:25 specifically I want to understand credit
02:27 cards okay
02:29 um
02:30 you know great
02:32 what is the data say credit card
02:34 the way I think about credit card is I
02:36 have a credit card I go I buy something
02:38 I swipe the credit card and let's say
02:39 petrol I say the more I go buy groceries
02:42 that's why
02:43 so I mean each of these is alone or what
02:47 so
02:49 I think
02:50 it really knows that right now
02:52 taking it is alone because because let
02:56 us say
02:57 I swipe today huh my credit card bill
03:00 comes on 7th of
03:03 September huh today is let's say fifth
03:07 my credit card bill will come on 7th of
03:09 September or whatever 17th of August the
03:12 credit card bill will get generated
03:14 generated and 7th of September I have to
03:17 pay
03:18 so actually
03:19 technically I have got credit I have got
03:23 a loan for 40 days 40 days so it's a
03:26 short duration known the thing is for
03:29 those 40 days I don't pay any interest
03:32 if I don't pay
03:35 on 7th of September I'm very curious how
03:39 does the credit card company make money
03:40 then
03:41 they charge very high rates of Interest
03:43 no they charge three percent a month but
03:46 if I pay I understand but if I pay I
03:49 have never
03:50 I don't maybe I have but I can't recall
03:53 recently at least I have never not paid
03:57 the monthly bill in full so I'm a bad
03:60 customer for a credit card company
04:04 well they make some money I think from
04:06 the merchant they make a lot of money
04:08 they make some money from the merchant I
04:10 think they charge a fee which is called
04:11 MDR okay
04:13 discount rate what is it
04:15 trade something yeah
04:23 something like that they charge the
04:25 merchant so every transactions if you
04:28 spend 40 000 rupees one and a half
04:29 percent this is a lot of money it's a
04:31 lot of money it is a lot of money and
04:33 for nothing you know what is it done
04:34 correct it's some digital thing which is
04:36 going through a bag almost 700 rupees
04:38 there's no cost it's going through bank
04:40 right so MasterCard has got just for
04:42 using the network for it to transact it
04:44 has made money on the on the slide
04:47 so there is I think a decent amount of
04:50 money they make like that
04:51 but this is a facility I think so
04:53 there's a loan facility that has been
04:54 given micro loan small loan I also think
04:56 that they make a lot of money so there
04:58 are people who don't pay their entire
05:00 bill
05:01 they make the date that it is due yeah
05:04 they make they've been making money on
05:05 interest and then the credit card
05:07 company charges three percent a month
05:10 which is very very high right two and a
05:12 half to three that is the range it's
05:14 less than what you might pay a money
05:15 lender yeah but only March
05:18 generally less than what you would pay
05:20 is this true yeah yeah three percent is
05:23 a lot it's a lot it's a lot so it's
05:25 exorbitant it's uh you know I mean if
05:27 you but it is unsecured credit right
05:29 they have no and it may be only for 10
05:31 days it may only be for 10 days so three
05:33 percent a month correct and you take it
05:35 for 10 days it's one percent so people
05:37 will be okay one percent I need 10 days
05:39 to pay my bill right I'm expecting some
05:41 money another 12 days I can't wait till
05:43 this that facility is there yes right so
05:45 it's a comfort in that sense so there's
05:48 a lot of value out of credit card but
05:50 here when in our data set can we just
05:53 see them and quickly check I think this
05:54 data set does not have all the credit
05:56 card translations right because this was
05:58 yes created from something so if we
06:01 looked at it we can see it I think it
06:04 contains only those which are durable so
06:06 we can see I think the way to look at I
06:09 think they have only captured they're
06:10 not captured grocery easily and all that
06:12 they only captured those things which
06:13 are basically loan type things so
06:14 durable purchases are the smallest value
06:18 how do you do it
06:23 um
06:24 by using subtitle because the filter
06:26 does it but when you filter when I will
06:28 filter it
06:31 right have you gone all the way to that
06:33 yeah oh okay yeah
06:40 so now if I take type of loan as credit
06:43 card
06:48 oh okay no no I think I didn't go right
06:50 to the end
06:53 they should have gone to some 5000 I
06:55 think it is
06:57 G
07:01 yeah
07:03 okay the smallest no so I have
07:06 I filtered on credit card yes
07:08 so the smallest loan size so subtotal
07:12 what is that five comma five is five is
07:15 uh it's telling me what function to use
07:16 five is midna yeah five is min
07:19 uh if I click on this it will tell you
07:26 I think only when you try to change it
07:27 okay so let me uh
07:30 two is Count three is Count a four is
07:33 Max 5 is min okay wise men all right so
07:35 this is the smallest credit card
07:38 transaction seems to be 200 and 2100
07:42 and the largest one so 200 will be
07:45 something somewhere yeah I don't know I
07:49 am something like that mixy
07:53 the largest one is 90 000. so that is
07:56 the Spread spread some refrigerator or
07:59 something could be
08:01 it could also be you know some vacation
08:03 airline tickets oh that also yeah it
08:05 could be no because people a lot of
08:07 people think they've only captured
08:08 retail right something they have said no
08:10 no it's a retail is a segment oh so it
08:14 could be purchased it could be okay
08:16 okay so it could be something some
08:19 vacation could be yeah
08:21 it could be Hotel
08:24 or it could be a consumer durable
08:27 it could be a television television
08:30 yeah
08:32 easily yeah
08:35 yeah okay
08:36 so
08:38 um so we have a range of 2019 average
08:41 also or we can we can find average
08:44 um
08:47 so that is averages in fact the first
08:53 average is about 30k this makes sense
08:56 makes sense yeah makes sense there's no
08:58 media now let's see
09:04 we don't have to remember which number
09:09 stands for which function this most
09:13 sheets will give you this very nice
09:15 prompt yeah
09:17 standard deviations no I think that's it
09:21 median is not not there huh
09:24 we can find first standard Division I
09:26 don't know I mean okay leave it doesn't
09:27 matter median is not media is on there
09:31 okay okay
09:47 large number of them
09:50 you can see it here itself you can see
09:52 there are of the ticket yes yes right
09:54 that's the first two examination will
09:56 tell you it's a few 12K these are the
09:58 smaller ones I guess yeah
10:00 but otherwise they're all like roughly
10:02 in the 25 to 35k range yeah isn't it
10:06 yeah
10:08 somewhere I saw 48k somewhere spit yeah
10:11 it is a 40K here so
10:16 okay
10:17 okay so now you want to analyze we shall
10:21 so of course analyze it I can analyze
10:23 using this subtotal but better you know
10:27 it's easier to analyze using a pivot
10:29 server let's so we'll take a pivot table
10:32 now I want a minute before you start
10:34 analyzing
10:35 we want to do some analysis by
10:38 uh
10:41 what kind of things we
10:43 average ticket size loans
10:46 that they have taken see I think the
10:49 first thing I would like to see is first
10:52 of all what is the market share of the
10:54 different kinds of lenders so who's
10:56 lending how much in credit card who's
10:58 basically
10:60 what said of the credit card lending is
11:04 Private Bank how much is public Bank how
11:05 much they'll be correct by number of
11:08 transactions
11:10 by value of transactions okay those are
11:13 the things right average values
11:14 translates that is number one number one
11:16 I would also if possible like to see how
11:20 this has changed over the years yeah I
11:21 want to lose the trend you want to see
11:23 the trend okay that is one second is
11:26 uh can we see this same thing
11:30 information
11:31 by the category of customer like
11:35 category as in here we have information
11:36 about the age yeah
11:39 so it will be interesting I think
11:41 because my impression at least TV is
11:43 that a lot of youngsters tend to splurge
11:45 on credit card yeah because they don't
11:47 have any liability so get married to
11:49 your children
11:50 correct you're worried about savings
11:52 older people are pension and all that
11:53 yeah younger guys
11:55 I think so but I don't want to do you
11:58 know see if you look at this age thing
12:00 it's got 20 25 some a lot of every one
12:03 age number is there okay too many too
12:06 many you want to group them
12:08 you should Define young medium age
12:10 middle age and older
12:13 um
12:15 young means
12:17 we will say age group can you see what
12:20 the age group is first of all just do
12:22 that filter filter on edge see the drop
12:24 down what does it look like
12:26 that maybe again
12:29 I can do it
12:35 I think
12:37 4 was
12:39 56 is the max
12:43 and
12:47 21 is the mean okay
12:50 so should we say less than 30 or
12:53 that is too old already we don't get
12:55 married by 30 we'll say 30 years yeah 30
12:59 to 50 is is in their children you know
13:02 middle age 10 days they see your
13:04 attention seniors let's divide like that
13:07 into three categories so we can do that
13:10 now the best way to do this is to use
13:13 ifs right so I've created a new column
13:15 called age group
13:16 say equal to
13:19 if
13:21 borrower age
13:23 is less than or equal to 30 yeah
13:27 then we call it then we call it youth
13:32 why is enough why is enough yeah as long
13:35 as you understand its youth okay
13:38 else
13:39 if
13:43 is less than or equal to 50
13:46 call it m Village
13:51 in otherwise we will say seniors serious
13:55 excellent y m and S okay yeah so this uh
13:59 is a senior correct 54 is a senior right
14:03 we'll just check a few whether we have
14:05 done it
14:07 so 35 is M that is correct 51 is s
14:11 46 is go to the next one your next one
14:14 should be y right
14:17 listen
14:21 yeah okay okay good nice yeah
14:38 oh
14:53 between these three a groups and also
14:57 male female oh
14:59 you get I think some demographic yeah I
15:01 don't know male female mental say much
15:03 but we'll see we'll see
15:05 Okay so we've got some age groups
15:09 so now you want to start with lender
15:10 first I mean what is the market share of
15:13 each lender by card type so let's do a
15:15 pivot I think
15:17 oh okay so select the data and insert
15:23 the pivot in a new worksheet
15:26 so we want to do a pivot table where we
15:29 can analyze
15:31 um
15:32 lender by lender type correct so so I'll
15:36 select the entire data select Delta Data
15:39 correct
15:41 no filters no I open this
15:45 including all the filters remove all the
15:47 filters okay
15:50 and I will select from here to
15:53 8003 okay
15:57 insert a pivot table and I'll do it in a
16:00 new worksheet oh
16:24 okay now tell me what do you want to
16:28 analyze on credit card we want to
16:30 analyze the
16:32 number of loans given given number of
16:36 transactions basically that means right
16:37 okay
16:39 there are there and you want this by
16:42 lender type by lender type
16:44 render type
16:46 yeah let's first only do this okay let's
16:48 type in number of loans
16:52 yeah
16:53 then can we make a pie chart on this yes
16:55 we can make a pie chart so this tells us
16:58 how many credit card transactions were
17:00 made this across all years these across
17:03 all years okay we'll see if you want I
17:05 can it will do it next let's first see
17:07 this
17:10 okay
17:12 you want me to put percentages be nice
17:14 to have percentage inside
17:16 okay
17:21 you want values instead of percentages
17:24 yeah
17:26 yeah
17:28 okay so this chart says what it says
17:32 58 of all transaction sections
17:36 originated by private bank correct
17:38 and uh nbfc 827 and the rest is small
17:43 number is correct
17:45 that's what it says can we do the same
17:47 thing now by
17:49 transaction size average transaction
17:51 size
17:52 across years yeah across yes facility
17:55 across this then we'll see trade
18:02 original loan size or outstanding loans
18:05 uh original launches
18:08 average you want average
18:13 so average of the loan that they have
18:15 given two minutes
18:18 very important to format it right yeah
18:22 so they're roughly same all roughly the
18:25 same correct all roughly the same in
18:27 this case pie chart doesn't make sense
18:29 but yeah always do the same okay
18:30 actually here the a better just as an
18:34 exercise what would be better perhaps is
18:37 to show it as a some scatter plot or
18:40 something budget ah bar chart
18:44 okay though it's it's really I mean this
18:48 visually it's not giving that impression
18:51 because so what you should really do is
18:54 to say format this
18:57 grid line
18:59 and you say you want it from sorry
19:07 for matte axis
19:09 you should say
19:12 from zero on it
19:15 yeah because then you'll see the size
19:17 correctly otherwise it will scale it
19:18 yeah now you can see it correctly
19:21 right yeah see in the original thing you
19:24 really thought that there was a
19:25 significant difference between the three
19:27 yeah because the uh
19:30 Y axis was starting only from 25 000 or
19:34 something current correct right but if
19:36 you format the y-axis correctly then you
19:40 can see actually there is not too much
19:41 difference right yeah
19:43 so I think in visual representation very
19:45 important too can we do one other thing
19:47 before we get into your voice trendwise
19:49 can we see this
19:52 being picking certain kinds of age
19:54 groups where this medium small senior
19:57 okay medium senior and youngster
20:00 so they say private bank is going for
20:02 young sir okay that may be a scatter
20:04 plot we'll see let's see first first
20:06 let's just see
20:08 count of each group
20:10 ah see PSU bank is targeting what no no
20:12 no no no this is actually this I should
20:15 move here
20:17 and then count of loan IDs
20:22 so Private Bank seems to be giving
20:25 mostly to Middle East
20:40 this way or this way stack without
20:43 percentage non percentage
20:49 private bank is giving to
20:52 now if you want to get the sense of
20:55 where they are focusing then it's better
20:56 to look at it as percentage
20:60 okay this will be a more
21:02 this will give you a more intuitive
21:03 field
21:06 so private bank is focusing on Middle
21:08 East
21:10 in general seniors are not
21:12 ices not I mean seniors are also
21:15 probably not very keen to take loans no
21:17 maybe yeah
21:19 nbfc is youngsters
21:27 banks are giving to youngsters
21:30 you see this this is a big number
21:32 almost 30 percent
21:39 but everybody is basically large percent
21:41 of their thing is going to middle middle
21:43 huh so it's you know
21:46 youngsters youngsters
21:51 new new job probably salaries are not
21:54 very high yeah yeah it's only after 30
21:59 that you get the capacity to repay emis
22:03 and therefore people spend more on
22:06 credit cards
22:09 yeah isn't it it seems to be the case
22:11 yeah
22:13 so um
22:16 Trend okay let's
22:21 can we see the for MSY can we see the
22:24 transaction size maybe that tells us
22:26 something also
22:28 the seniors may be having
22:30 taking bigger medium guys may be taking
22:33 youngsters maybe taking smaller ones I
22:35 don't know
22:36 there's some color like that you can get
22:41 average of originating
22:51 no seems to be roughly the same
22:55 roughly the same
22:59 of course this doesn't this graph
23:02 doesn't make sense in this case
23:07 which is this too
23:12 it doesn't make sense
23:13 okay so there's no difference
23:15 no not particularly
23:19 they're all buying a television small
23:21 television or something something I
23:22 don't know what they're doing
23:24 laughs
23:26 okay okay
23:28 what would you look at Trend now Trend
23:30 yeah so has it changed how has it
23:32 changed what has changed this itself we
23:35 can see has the average changed over
23:38 years
23:39 yeah do it the other way row is this
23:41 column move the row to column and column
23:43 move viewers here
23:48 as it is
23:49 somewhat
23:51 but this is also not the right to three
23:55 bars Reading or you should do a line
23:58 ah line is better multiple lines uh line
24:01 is better
24:02 yeah
24:04 doesn't seem to have no it's marginally
24:07 going up not marginally going on but
24:11 right it's gone from 30 to 35 km but
24:13 inflation tracking aging doesn't seem to
24:15 be uh age is not a factor not a fact in
24:17 the ticket size
24:19 oh
24:21 change the ticket size to number of
24:23 loans
24:35 ah
24:37 what does it saying seniors are taking
24:40 lessons are flat basically maybe during
24:44 covert there became even more
24:46 conservative youngsters are Gango medium
24:49 guys are going on
24:50 as usual they're not affected at all
24:56 this is interesting
24:59 okay
25:01 seriously reduce your flat whereas media
25:03 I think they became probably more
25:04 anxious
25:06 something like that something like that
25:08 even otherwise they were not growing
25:10 much no
25:11 that is intuitively I think it makes
25:13 sense really
25:14 in general I have not seen 50 year olds
25:17 get very adventurous
25:21 yeah do you know how many people are
25:24 there
25:25 we can count
25:26 you want that
25:30 I think we can go filter on that end no
25:32 no we can just okay pivot turns us
25:35 everything
25:43 okay
25:47 so there are 400 middle aged people 91
25:51 seniors and 160 youngsters
25:55 so there are less seniors so that as a
25:57 percentage of the number it may be
25:58 constant
25:59 Maybe
26:00 yeah no we saw its number of course
26:03 they're declining
26:09 so what it tells you really GV is that
26:12 not too many seniors use credit cards
26:14 that is true yeah isn't it only 90
26:18 transactions are there people who really
26:19 use credit cards are the 30 to 50 year
26:22 olds yeah that's what it's saying isn't
26:26 it that's what it's saying but the
26:27 youngsters are getting it
26:31 yeah yeah
26:35 that's what it's saying
26:37 actually this may not be unique we don't
26:40 know yeah because we don't have borrower
26:42 ID you know they have no transactions
26:44 correct
26:46 correct we don't know it could be the
26:48 same senior doing 90 transactions it
26:50 could be one guy doing 90 transactions
26:52 you don't know that
26:54 because we don't have borrower ID we
26:57 only have loan ID we have a age it's a
26:59 proxy and gender okay
27:03 all right so okay I mean what you can do
27:05 with the data is limited but because
27:08 they don't have too many fields but even
27:11 then you can do a lot that's what you're
27:12 seeing yes right yes with some analysis
27:14 you can still do even though the fields
27:15 of you
27:16 okay
