00:00 [Music]
00:15 my name is ashwin badiga and with me is
00:17 hari haran hi and we are phd research
00:20 scholars uh in the advanced stage uh
00:23 we'll be completing soon hopefully and
00:26 we are also the co tutors for the course
00:28 on business data management
00:31 and today we are here to discuss uh
00:32 regarding the capstone project so hari
00:35 could you please tell me as to what a
00:37 capstone project is and why is that we
00:39 are doing this
00:41 so what essentially happens in a
00:43 capstone project now that you have uh
00:46 four weeks of
00:48 understanding about what business data
00:50 management what is happening in the
00:51 business data management and you may
00:53 also be looking at
00:55 case studies in the ensuing weeks
00:59 that will give up overall perspective
01:02 about how data is managed in the
01:03 business
01:04 this captain project goes a little
01:06 further ahead when it comes to
01:09 this business data management course
01:11 where you actually try and collect
01:14 primary data from different sources and
01:17 then use it for uh
01:19 i mean and
01:20 collect the data and analyze the data
01:22 and interpret the data so that certain
01:24 insights come out of it that's the very
01:26 purpose of doing this capstone project
01:28 and
01:29 that's the intention with which this
01:31 capstone project is introduced in this
01:32 particular business data management
01:34 harry you did mention that something
01:36 about primary data collection or what is
01:39 this primary data collection and how is
01:41 it different from a secondary data okay
01:43 so when you look at the primary data
01:47 for this
01:48 primary generally data is classified
01:50 into primary data and the secondary data
01:53 the primary data
01:54 is the data that you actually collect
01:57 from the source itself
01:59 whereas the secondary data is the data
02:02 which is available in the internet or it
02:04 could be available in certain public
02:06 document or whatever it is and you use
02:08 that for data analysis so this is the
02:10 primary classification that we do on any
02:14 data for that so in the capstone project
02:16 we typically expect students to do a
02:18 primary data collection yes collect the
02:20 data you clean the data you analyze data
02:24 and you plot certain trends take
02:26 make interpretation interpretations so
02:28 what is going to happen when you do this
02:30 kind of interpretation how is it going
02:31 to help the decision makers or how is it
02:33 going to help anybody
02:35 fine now that we know what capstone
02:37 project is yes what is that we are going
02:39 to do in this capstone project okay and
02:42 uh how is that it is going to be useful
02:45 okay for anybody that i'm going to do
02:47 yes so this capstone project is a unique
02:50 opportunity to carry out independent
02:52 research which will help you collect the
02:54 data you will be cleaning it you will be
02:56 analyzing the data and will be plotting
02:58 certain various trends that will help
03:00 the decision maker or the person who has
03:02 given you the data to come up with
03:03 better decision making it will help a
03:05 manager to solve a real world problem so
03:08 what typically you are going to do as
03:10 harry mentioned earlier is that you are
03:11 going to collect primary data by primary
03:14 data we mean that you are going to meet
03:16 the people directly and going to collect
03:18 data from them rather than collecting
03:19 the data from already available sources
03:21 so this is the main difference and
03:23 whenever you're doing a kind of primary
03:25 data collection it is quite complicated
03:27 because you know it is not something
03:28 which is direct you need to speak to the
03:30 people there are a lot of challenges
03:32 which is happening currently the
03:33 pandemic is there but we would also like
03:35 to show you as to how we have done it to
03:37 give you certain idea as to how this
03:39 capstone project is to be approached
03:41 and
03:42 though project of this scope and scale
03:44 is quite challenging i'm sure that
03:46 you're going to enjoy as you work on
03:49 this particular project this is going to
03:51 be an individual exercise and you're
03:53 going to collect data at least for a
03:55 period of one month so for example today
03:57 is 25th of september so if you are going
03:59 to collect the data on 25th of september
04:01 you are going to typically collect data
04:03 for a period of one month so what can
04:04 you do with this so you can analyze
04:06 trends for a weekly
04:08 on a weekly basis you can analyze the
04:10 trends on a monthly basis you can
04:11 analyze the trends for every 10 days or
04:13 every 14 days or something like that
04:15 yeah
04:16 i shouldn't be it will also be good if
04:18 you can tell them as to where they can
04:21 collect the data definitely so firstly
04:23 what we are going to do is that me and
04:24 hari had
04:26 just for the sake of illustration so we
04:28 visited one of the wholesaler merchant
04:30 in chennai and we requested him to share
04:32 the data so we are going to show you
04:33 that first and then we are going to give
04:35 certain ideas as to how you can approach
04:37 now you might be having a question that
04:39 given that it is pandemic it is
04:40 uncertain times you cannot go out and
04:42 collect the data but you know it's that
04:44 simple you just don't have to go very
04:45 far you can speak to a kirana store
04:48 which is near your home you can also
04:49 speak to a laundry person who is
04:53 you can speak to a person
04:55 who owns a laundry shop you can also
04:57 speak to a vegetable vendor or anybody
04:60 but typically what you have to do is
05:01 that you will be in constantly in touch
05:03 and you will be collecting data for a
05:04 period of one month so this is what you
05:06 have to do so what is that you are
05:08 expected to do it is very simple just
05:10 step out you don't have to go very far
05:12 see places around you and collect the
05:14 data it's that simple
05:16 make friends with uh yes and typically
05:19 in this process you tend to understand
05:20 the shopkeepers and let me point out to
05:22 you that hari in india if you look at
05:25 the market which is there it is more of
05:28 unstructured and unorganized so you know
05:30 you have to you know taking him taking
05:33 them into confidence and giving them a
05:35 feeling that you know you have to take
05:36 them into confidence and you just tell
05:38 them that this is a part of your project
05:39 and we are going to give you certain
05:41 insights which is going to help you in
05:42 making better decisions
05:44 so me and hari are now going to explain
05:46 as to what we have done this is for
05:48 illustration purpose and to give you an
05:50 understanding of what a capstone project
05:51 is so what we did is that we both
05:53 visited a merchant wholesaler and
05:55 requested the owner to share certain
05:57 transaction details and typically most
06:00 of these businesses like merchant
06:02 businesses or wholesale business they
06:04 operate on a day-to-day basis and most
06:07 of their transactions are recorded on
06:09 books rather than the softwares so all
06:11 these softwares are done with
06:12 supermarkets and stuff but if you if you
06:14 go to a sub-g monday if you go to a
06:15 marketplace you don't have any you don't
06:17 have any complex systems in place they
06:19 just have a book where they note their
06:20 day-to-day transaction and if you have
06:22 to ask them okay what is the difference
06:24 between last month's sales and this
06:25 month sales so they'll not be able to
06:27 give you accurate description as to what
06:29 has really happened yes so you don't
06:31 have scratching there they would be
06:32 scratching their head you know they
06:33 would not be knowing how much they have
06:35 realized what has been the profits which
06:37 is you know something which you feel
06:39 it's a drawback and
06:41 don't you think it's a very
06:42 good value addition to the shopkeepers
06:45 definitely it's a very good value
06:46 addition to the shopkeepers and most
06:48 importantly
06:49 i would also like to state that you know
06:50 a lot of food also gets wasted so
06:53 typically when you collect the data when
06:55 you are giving them with certain
06:56 insights a wastage also can be could be
06:58 prevented in first first place you could
07:00 also identify the stock which is moving
07:02 very fast and procure them and keep in
07:04 advance you could identify the
07:06 slow-moving stock you can also identify
07:08 the non-moving stock so all these things
07:10 can be identified when you do a capstone
07:12 project
07:13 so what we did was that we
07:15 we went uh to chennai a street in
07:19 chennai
07:20 and we collected data from a wholesaler
07:21 merchants for the period of wholesaler
07:23 merchant for the period of may and june
07:24 2021
07:26 so what we have done is we have changed
07:28 the names of the various goods sold but
07:29 the remaining details like the opening
07:31 stock the um the item which was procured
07:34 the sales everything remains the same
07:36 the prices and all is correct because we
07:37 had to maintain anonymity
07:39 and in the below table i am showing you
07:42 all the details of the incoming stock
07:43 the sales quantity the price and the
07:46 closing stock now what uh what is that
07:48 i've done with this this also gave me
07:50 information about what was the lead time
07:52 for procurement how much i mean when did
07:55 they procure it and when did they sell
07:56 it this is very very important right you
07:57 would not typically want to stock your
07:60 vegetables or your groceries for longer
08:02 periods because every item has its own
08:04 shelf life so in addition to that i
08:07 could also help identify i could also
08:09 identify what was fast moving what was
08:11 slowing moving and what was not moving
08:12 all these insights briefly we have given
08:14 in the table below so we have collected
08:16 data for two time periods that is we
08:18 have collected data completely for the
08:20 month of may as well as for the as well
08:22 as the month of june and we'll be
08:24 showing as to how we have done it and
08:26 then you are expected to do it on the
08:27 similar lines and will also be giving
08:29 you ideas on how you have to proceed
08:31 further and and this data is collected
08:33 at the peak of the pandemic yes so we
08:35 have not an excuse
08:37 pandemic is not an excuse to say that oh
08:40 we can i mean we can't collect the data
08:42 so typically you don't have to go even
08:43 far you know you can just speak to
08:44 people around you you you really don't
08:46 know you are going to help somebody out
08:47 and you know if you can bring a smile on
08:49 their face what is that more you need so
08:51 okay so here you typically see the
08:53 various particulars which is the goods
08:55 which is being sold by xyz merchants so
08:58 xyz traders in chennai so the opening
09:00 balance is nothing but the inventory of
09:02 these existing goods which were there in
09:04 his warehouse so he typically sold some
09:07 15 to 20 items and he's a wholesaler so
09:10 wholesaler means they typically sell in
09:13 25 or 30 kgs and not like what is being
09:15 sold in the retail stores so that is why
09:17 you will find that the rates are very
09:19 less than what you see in the retail
09:21 stores so uh he had nine thousand eight
09:24 hundred and nine thousand eight hundred
09:25 kgs of gram one which was priced fifteen
09:28 rupees forty one pisces and which is
09:30 valued at approximately one lakh fifty
09:32 one thousand so the next thing is a
09:34 column which is called as inwards by
09:36 inverse we mean that the amount the the
09:39 procurement which he has done from the
09:41 producer and which has come inside and
09:43 what happened is on in the month of may
09:45 they procured 15 800 kgs at a price of
09:49 16 rupees 74 percent now you may be
09:51 asking me as to why when in stock the
09:54 price was 15 rupees 41 peso
09:56 but when it was procured it is 16 rupees
09:58 74 percent yes so hari
10:02 could you please explain as to why this
10:03 is the case so
10:05 when you look at these
10:07 products
10:08 the price is not going to be the same
10:10 because the price the products uh prices
10:13 dependent on the demand which you would
10:15 have read in your economics class just
10:18 two or three weeks before so the prices
10:20 fluctuate based on demand correct so the
10:23 demand for gram one in this particular
10:26 case
10:27 when this was initially bought could be
10:30 very less and therefore the price could
10:32 be at
10:33 15 rupees and 41 pi say and something
10:36 could have happened in the ensuing
10:37 period in the month of may 1st to may
10:39 31st uh
10:41 may 31 so where the price could have
10:44 increased
10:46 maybe pandemic could be the reason yes
10:48 maybe
10:50 i mean unavailability of transport could
10:52 be the reason the rise in the petrol
10:54 price or the diesel price could be the
10:55 reason because of which
10:57 the inward price has increased yes okay
10:60 and and
11:01 during the pandemic we also saw that you
11:03 know people were buying more than what
11:05 they actually wanted yes so what happens
11:07 is that you know the demand the supply
11:09 the demand is more than what is being
11:11 supplied so that kind of creates a
11:14 disequilibrium in the system and then
11:15 the corresponding changes in the prices
11:18 it also can be seen from the uh outwards
11:21 which is being sold to the customer
11:23 customers and you see that you know 16
11:26 100 kgs were sold at an average price of
11:29 18 rupees 12 i say
11:31 can can i assume that uh
11:34 by selling at 18 rupees and 12 percent
11:36 yes where you bought it at 16 rupees and
11:38 74 paisa okay the difference is the
11:41 margin for me definitely yes but however
11:44 you have to note here that uh 15 800 kgs
11:47 was what was being brought you already
11:50 had
11:51 989 800 in stock yes okay so when you
11:55 add
11:55 800 with 15 800 you typically get
11:58 something like 25 600 now out of 25 600
12:01 16 100 is being sold so you know when
12:04 you yes definitely it's a profit so when
12:06 you compare it uh with what is being
12:08 bought and what is being sold there is
12:09 definitely a you do see a price
12:11 difference of one rupees and 38 pisces
12:13 approximately yes and then you are
12:15 having the closing balance where that is
12:17 at the end of 31st whatever is being
12:19 left is it is the closing balance which
12:21 will be taken as inventory for the next
12:23 time period now you might be having one
12:25 more question that when we so the value
12:27 is obtained by multiplying the quantity
12:29 with the rate so if you look at the
12:31 first uh if you look at the row
12:33 once open balance 9800 into 15.41 gave
12:36 me approximately one point five x
12:39 fifteen thousand eight hundred into
12:40 sixteen point seven four give me this
12:42 much which is approximately two lakh
12:43 sixty five thousand sixteen thousand one
12:45 hundred into eighteen point one two gave
12:47 me approximately two lakh ninety one
12:48 thousand so is the closing balance value
12:51 the summation of opening balance value
12:54 plus inverse minus outwards the answer
12:56 is no the simple reason being there is a
12:58 fluctuation in the rates and that is why
13:01 the the quantity would not be the same
13:03 because whatever you are having has a
13:05 closing balance which is 9500 kgs that
13:08 particular day's price would be given
13:10 and the value would be fixed on that
13:11 particular price however if you if you
13:13 compute the quantities 9800 plus 15 800
13:16 is 25 600 25 600 minus 16 hundred is
13:20 nine thousand one hundred nine thousand
13:21 five hundred so if you look at that the
13:23 quantities will be the same however you
13:25 will see that the price is not the same
13:26 because the price in in markets the
13:28 price fluctuates on a daily basis
13:30 another example for you to make you
13:32 understand is that suppose you bought a
13:34 kg of tomatoes for 10 rupees and you go
13:36 tomorrow to the same store the
13:37 probability that it will be of the same
13:40 price is very less almost you know it is
13:42 i can just say that there is very low
13:43 probability yes which is there so again
13:46 then what we did is
13:47 we again asked him to provide us data
13:50 for the next time period and as you know
13:53 whatever is the inventory at the end of
13:56 inventory at the end of may 31st is the
13:59 opening stock for the month of
14:02 june first and then again certain
14:04 inwards happen inwards is they had
14:06 procured from the producer again certain
14:08 items were sold and the closing balance
14:10 which is being given so similarly from
14:12 this what you can do is that you can
14:13 plot certain trends you can look at a
14:15 weekly basis now this is all a collated
14:17 output which are presenting to you in
14:18 fact we had data for every point so we
14:20 collected it on first second third
14:22 fourth this is the collective output
14:23 which you're seeing but when you are
14:25 doing this we would typically want you
14:27 to analyze on a weekly basis or a
14:28 monthly basis or a fortnightly basis
14:30 what is the change so i hope that you
14:32 now that you have been introduced to
14:33 various graphs uh during the graphical
14:36 so
14:38 don't you think that we can easily make
14:40 a trend graph out of this particular
14:41 exactly exactly and what how is it going
14:43 to help the decision makers yes see uh
14:47 maybe having two month data correct
14:49 might not really help when it comes to
14:51 trend analysis correct but if you have
14:53 imagine a one year data you will come to
14:56 know at what point in time the product
14:59 is being sold more or the product is
15:01 being sold less exactly and therefore
15:03 correspondingly the price also varies
15:05 according to the demand of the product
15:07 yes so
15:08 as a retailer as a wholesaler in this
15:11 context i would like to have more of the
15:14 product when the price is very high yes
15:16 yes and less of the product when the
15:18 product price is very low so
15:22 this is for a wholesaler but for a
15:24 retailer the cycle need not be even
15:26 six months or one year it can be even
15:28 two months or one month that should be
15:30 enough yes you go talk to a retailer he
15:32 will exactly come to say that the price
15:35 of some product
15:37 varies within a week also yes so uh i i
15:40 go to shop to buy uh vegetables for my
15:43 home
15:44 um
15:45 first today i go and see the tomatoes
15:47 price will be like 25 rupees the next
15:49 day it will be 30 rupees
15:51 uh next day it will be 35 rupees and
15:53 then it might come to 15 rupees again i
15:55 asked them why there is so much
15:56 fluctuation he says sir in coimbatore
15:59 market we did not get tomato exactly
16:01 okay so
16:02 uh retailers story will be different
16:05 from wholesaler story and that will be
16:07 different from the manufacturer's story
16:10 so just
16:11 you must be very clear as to what kind
16:13 of story you want to say correct so if
16:14 you want to go and say a story about a
16:16 retailer about his price fluctuations
16:18 and other things you might have to
16:20 collect data appropriately for that and
16:23 one more thing which i observed here was
16:25 that you know so they typically
16:27 wholesalers do not sell typically less
16:28 than 25 kgs so uh so they were selling
16:31 horse gram for approximately 31 rupees a
16:34 kg so typically if a customer has to buy
16:36 a minimum of 25 kg and just out of
16:38 curiosity i went to the retail store
16:40 same thing which was being sold for 31
16:41 rupees
16:42 uh 1 kg packet was being sold at 95
16:45 rupees so you see the difference you
16:47 know it is like 60 rupees difference but
16:49 then you may be then there naturally may
16:51 be a question as to why this difference
16:52 is used see when you get this particular
16:55 groceries there is transportation cost
16:57 involved there are many other costs that
16:59 are involved you have to clean it
17:01 because these grains will be having a
17:03 lot of dust so you would be clearing it
17:05 you'll be packing it and then you'll be
17:06 selling it to your final cut there'll
17:07 also be some waste stages there will be
17:09 wastages so all these costs get added
17:11 and that is how why the retail prices
17:13 are pretty much higher one more example
17:15 which i would like to say is that
17:16 recently hari
17:17 you know our nandini tea store and where
17:21 typically they sell something called as
17:23 dhokla which is a gujarati kind of
17:25 steamed gujarati snack and many of us
17:28 really like it i hope you also like it
17:29 which is served with nice
17:31 chutney chutney
17:32 chutney so mint chutney yeah so what
17:35 happened is that
17:36 we had been
17:37 i almost visit there once every two or
17:40 three days and every day whenever i have
17:42 visited after six o'clock dhoklas were
17:44 not available
17:45 and then i asked him as to why doh class
17:48 if if it is getting sold every day so
17:51 typically he makes twenty five thirty
17:52 dollars and if it is getting sold every
17:54 day by six o'clock why is that he does
17:56 not make forty dollars
17:58 so he told me that uh you know um the
18:01 day i make 40 dollars the day i make
18:02 extra dough class nothing gets sold so
18:05 everything becomes a waste yes so i said
18:08 no that could not be the reason
18:10 so that could not be the reason so do
18:12 you know as to why it was not getting
18:13 sold
18:15 maybe festivities maybe yes so typically
18:19 people prefer to eat certain days in a
18:21 week they do not prefer to eat certain
18:23 days outside and that was the very
18:25 reason as to why dough classes are not
18:27 sold on the other days so initially what
18:30 he assumed has the reason for non uh
18:33 i mean uh the reason as to why these
18:35 documents were not sold it was kind of a
18:37 spurious correlation where he attributed
18:38 it to you know you make
18:40 luck you say that you make a lot of
18:42 dough class it would not be sold the
18:43 answer was not that the answer was that
18:45 typically when i visited five to six
18:46 times i observed that on certain days of
18:48 the week the customers would not want to
18:50 dine outside and that was the very
18:52 reason as to why the row class were not
18:53 being sold so then i gave him this
18:55 particular insight and then he reworked
18:57 on it and he increased the document
18:58 quantity so that's very nice so this is
19:00 one thing which so but there is also one
19:04 important insight that we must have to
19:06 learn yes the location of the place yes
19:08 location of the place also is very very
19:09 so if it is if this particular nandini t
19:12 store is going to be located in a
19:14 central locality say tinagar in chennai
19:17 is very central locality where different
19:19 sort of people come at all the time so
19:21 at that point in time
19:23 the idea of festivity may not work yes
19:25 yes because people might have i mean
19:28 different type of people might have uh
19:30 doctors at different uh you kind of have
19:32 a moving population it's a moving
19:34 population so therefore uh
19:36 the demand is kind of normalized it
19:39 depends on various conditions there are
19:41 certain contextual uh factors which come
19:43 into place which uh in fact uh you know
19:46 alter your demand and supply correct and
19:48 i mean that is what we expect you as a
19:51 student to understand
19:52 and
19:53 provide an insight that be really useful
19:56 for
19:56 the shopkeeper or retailer or whoever
19:59 you're going to help out with the data
20:01 so
20:02 that's the very idea of this capstone
20:04 project where you actually talk to the
20:06 people
20:07 collect data try to organize the data
20:09 like the way ashwin had explained you
20:11 how organizing the data so he has
20:14 organized individual
20:15 everyday data into collected them into
20:17 and put them into a monthly data correct
20:20 likewise you may have to organize the
20:21 data in a weekly format or a fortnightly
20:24 format or a monthly format and if you
20:25 wish to do a little more also it's fine
20:27 yeah so you can do that you kind of draw
20:29 graphs because always they say that
20:31 pictures are remembered better than
20:32 words so my professor used to say that
20:35 with picture you can't yes so
20:38 when you have certain trends you can
20:39 analyze and then you can predict what
20:41 kind of demand is happening is there a
20:42 spike is there a fall what is the fast
20:45 moving stock what is the slow moving
20:46 stock what is non-moving what should be
20:48 the reorder point etcetera all this
20:50 could be determined so now we have the
20:52 now that we have explained you all this
20:53 where is that you can collect the data
20:55 from yes you can collect it from the
20:56 kirana stores you could also collect it
20:58 from cab abbreviators ola and uber now
21:00 you know ola and uber uber has this uber
21:03 go uber suv uber they have different you
21:06 know different vehicles catering to
21:08 different segments correct so typically
21:10 you can just speak to the drivers try to
21:11 understand how many trips they are
21:12 making per day how much they are
21:14 realizing from it have a monthly data
21:16 and then
21:17 you can suggest the driver as to in this
21:20 particular day in a month yes instead of
21:22 taking uber go trips try to take uber
21:24 outstation
21:26 so you can make more money by doing that
21:27 yes that's the idea that's the kind of
21:29 insight that you may want to give to the
21:31 cab driver and i i'm sure that you'll be
21:34 certainly happy about that in fact you
21:36 can also visit tea and coffee shops
21:38 because you know business is picking up
21:40 well you can visit the supermarket
21:41 stores well when you talk about tea and
21:43 coffee shops in chennai there might be
21:45 around
21:46 20 to 30
21:48 shops with the name chai chai chai guli
21:51 chai shastra blah blah blah so you can
21:53 take any one of that kind of shop and
21:55 then maybe you can also visit
21:56 supermarket stores like big bazaar just
21:58 have a look at things around you you can
21:60 also go for go for laundry services
22:02 visit a laundry services store and there
22:04 are many more so we leave it to your
22:06 imagination and we hope that we have
22:08 convinced you as to what a capstone
22:10 project is and we look forward
22:13 to your projects and uh interacting with
22:15 you further in a nutshell ashwin would
22:17 you like to list down
22:19 the entire process in a minute or two so
22:21 that they'll be very clear about yeah so
22:23 now that we have explained you what the
22:25 capstone project is so you typically
22:27 first go and speak to the service
22:29 provider you visit a store and give them
22:31 the confidence as to why you're doing
22:32 this i mean don't just do it for marks
22:35 you know you should also have that
22:36 intrinsic satisfaction that you're
22:37 contributing to something so you will be
22:39 giving them the confidence you will be
22:41 explaining the purpose as to why you are
22:42 doing this and how is that they are
22:44 going to be benefited so once that is
22:46 done you would be collecting the data
22:48 the minimum time period is one month you
22:50 will be cleaning the data you will be
22:52 analyzing the data you will be plotting
22:53 certain trends and you'll be giving
22:54 you'll be also listing the set of
22:56 implications what has been your
22:57 learnings and what is that what is that
23:00 can help the decision maker from all
23:02 this analysis that you have done how is
23:04 it going to help the decision maker and
23:06 in what ways it has actually helped them
23:08 if you can go one step further so i hope
23:10 uh you will enjoy working on your
23:13 capstone project and we look forward uh
23:16 to meeting you all soon yeah so yeah so
23:18 that's it from us have a good day bye
