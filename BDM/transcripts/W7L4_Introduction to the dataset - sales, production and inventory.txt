00:00 [Music]
00:15 uh
00:17 so maybe it's a good time now to start
00:19 looking uh
00:21 uh now that you've given us this broad
00:24 overview
00:25 uh maybe a good idea to start looking at
00:27 a
00:29 data exactly fantastic
00:33 okay
00:35 uh
00:36 so julie uh we'll have shiv walkers
00:38 through the data right right
00:41 yeah
00:42 so you want to open the excel uh
00:45 i will open this and open the x
00:48 so um
00:49 so perhaps we can start as i said you
00:51 know we are going to go from
00:54 the customer
00:55 backwards right the sales backwards in
00:58 the value chain of the company so first
00:59 thing we look at is the sales
01:01 information which is basically
01:04 how much of the product was sold and
01:06 what price was it sold
01:08 and
01:08 during each month so
01:10 all of this data most of the status
01:12 available for the entire 24 months
01:14 uh so from april 2019 all the way to
01:17 march 2021
01:19 to show
01:21 all the different impacts that happened
01:22 right the ps4 to bs6 transition
01:25 the impact of kobe the recovery from
01:27 kobe and so on so forth
01:29 um so what you see in the sales data is
01:32 as i said the 10 gear assemblies which
01:34 are the finished products that the ace
01:35 is selling and for each of those gear
01:38 assemblies you will see the sales for
01:40 each month
01:41 for example what you're seeing right now
01:43 is april 2019 uh it shows the total
01:47 sales of that gear assembly the numbers
01:50 to 8960
01:52 units of that finished product was sold
01:54 and the price at which it was sold 420
01:57 rupees that was the price it was sold at
01:60 and so on so you see
02:02 for may 2019 june 2019 quantity and
02:06 price
02:07 for all of the
02:09 uh the months right
02:12 the 24 months so that's the first data
02:14 set that you'll see
02:15 and when you see this data set i think
02:17 you see the impacts that we talked about
02:20 in the sales you will see
02:22 that products number one two
02:25 are the ps4 parts
02:27 you'll see that there the sales of those
02:29 products so one of the things that i
02:31 want to
02:33 you to analyze is what happens to sales
02:35 of those ps four products
02:37 as the transition to bs6 happens um
02:41 on april 1st 2020. so that's the first
02:43 question
02:44 and then you will see that
02:47 the parts
02:48 number
02:50 three to uh
02:53 three to eight they are applicable for
02:55 both vs4 and vs6 so that means that
02:58 their sales are not going to stop just
02:59 because of ps4 or six but can you see
03:02 some seasonal pattern in the year that's
03:04 my second question seasonal pattern
03:07 means at some point in the year the
03:08 sales is high and then another point in
03:10 the year the same snow can because we
03:12 have two years we can start to see
03:15 potentially some seasonal patterns so my
03:17 second question is are there any
03:18 seasonal patterns you see
03:20 in the sales data
03:22 and then the last set of products is the
03:24 bs6 products which
03:26 initially you'll see zero because vs6 is
03:28 not kicking till april 1st 2020
03:31 and then you'll start to see their sales
03:32 so the question on that one is how what
03:35 is the pattern of sales of these bs6
03:38 products did they when did they start
03:40 selling and why did they start selling
03:42 at that point
03:43 uh when you did see their things start
03:46 so that is the third question the fourth
03:49 question is what is the impact of covet
03:51 uh on the sales of these products so as
03:54 production actually
03:56 uh and sales actually slowed down after
03:58 the pandemic stuck in march 2020
04:02 what kind of impact are we seeing from
04:04 the pandemic uh
04:07 through
04:08 through the next several months right as
04:10 the first wave hit and then receive it
04:13 what kind of impact do you see in the
04:15 sales of these products so that's
04:17 another
04:18 question i have
04:20 then i also want to find out some things
04:22 like what what are the products that are
04:24 giving me the highest sales quantity
04:27 and what are the products that are
04:28 giving me the highest sales value value
04:31 means revenue right which means not only
04:33 that so if you multiply the quantity and
04:35 the price and that's when you get the
04:36 sales value so which products gave me
04:39 the the best sales value that i should
04:41 pay more attention to because i
04:43 obviously want
04:45 to pay a lot of attention to products
04:46 that giving me a lot of revenue i want
04:49 to make sure that there's no shortage of
04:51 those products and so on so those those
04:53 are other questions i have on that first
04:55 table right what's
04:57 what's the products that are giving me
04:58 the maximum revenue what are the
05:00 products that are giving me the minimum
05:01 revenue uh which means uh you know i
05:04 might rethink whether it's worth selling
05:06 those products in the next coming years
05:07 so those are some questions i have on
05:09 that first table
05:11 you see
05:13 okay
05:15 the
05:16 next table
05:18 uh seems to be more
05:20 from a
05:21 regional perspective i see
05:26 yeah
05:28 maybe you can help us understand this
05:31 table
05:32 yes absolutely so what we then say is
05:35 because asia cells in all four regions
05:38 of the country
05:39 right
05:40 and automobile clusters are there as you
05:42 know in multiple parts so around the
05:44 west right mumbai pune especially you
05:47 have a cluster of manufacturers i mean
05:49 the south of course chennai is
05:51 the detroit of uh of india so there is a
05:53 lot of manufacturing activity there's
05:55 also east and north where significant
05:59 activity happens for companies such as
06:01 tata motors
06:02 um and mahindra's and so on so so the
06:05 regional sales distribution is is given
06:08 for just three months and is given only
06:11 for the eight products in this
06:12 particular case this because of course
06:14 the
06:15 product nine and ten were not selling in
06:17 that particular three months we looked
06:19 at october 2019 november 2019 and
06:23 december 2018 so you this is called the
06:25 q3 of the financial year 20. so you'll
06:28 see three months and for each of the
06:30 three months you'll see for the eight
06:31 products that were selling at that time
06:34 you'll see the overall sales but it also
06:37 see in which region how many units of
06:39 that product sold so you'll see north
06:41 east west and south so if you take gear
06:43 assembly one for example in october 2019
06:46 it sold 14 400
06:49 units right and most of the sales came
06:52 from east and south so 11 200 units in
06:55 east and 3 200 from south there were no
06:58 sales in north and west for that
06:60 particular family that could be because
07:02 that assembly is used by a
07:05 particular manufacturer who only has
07:07 factories in east and south right um
07:09 that could be the reason for that and
07:11 similarly you would see for all of the
07:13 eight gears what's the regional sales
07:16 for each of the four meters so that's
07:18 what's there in this table
07:20 and in terms of questions around this
07:23 table
07:24 um i want to understand um you know
07:26 which regions are most important to me
07:28 where is that
07:30 i'm getting
07:30 the maximum sales quantity but also the
07:34 maximum sales revenue uh now you have to
07:38 look at both tables to figure the
07:39 revenue side of it um so that's one part
07:42 i want to find out and then i also want
07:44 to find out
07:46 is there uh i could for example i could
07:48 give
07:50 specific focus to some regions by
07:52 appointing a regional sales agent uh so
07:55 what these regional sales agents do is
07:57 they are actually stationed or located
07:59 in that particular region in one of the
08:00 cities and they are making sure that
08:03 account that they will make sure that
08:04 the customers in that region get regular
08:06 with it
08:08 their feedback is incorporated the
08:09 schedules are clarified and so on then
08:12 the agents can actually
08:13 help improve customer relationship and
08:15 also improve the sales so if i if i want
08:18 to appoint a few agents then which
08:20 region should i appoint these agents in
08:22 and how many agents should i appoint in
08:24 each region
08:25 if i want a point agent in such a way
08:28 that
08:29 it is
08:30 somewhat related to the amount of
08:31 revenue i am making from that region so
08:33 every region in which i'm making
08:36 uh you know more than a certain number
08:38 of products are sold or revenue is
08:40 gathered i want to appoint those agents
08:42 and i have a fixed budget for how many
08:44 agents i can appoint then how should i
08:47 appoint those agents which region should
08:49 i point more which is region should i
08:51 point less so that's another question
08:54 that uh that i would like to have and
08:56 then i'd also like to see
08:58 are there
08:59 some products that are clustered in some
09:01 region right some products are only in
09:03 certain region some products and only in
09:06 certain other region is there a pattern
09:07 like that so those are some of the
09:09 questions that i have from the regional
09:11 perspective
09:13 okay
09:16 then the next table seems to be
09:20 uh
09:21 i've let me unfreeze this
09:24 and
09:26 now let's look at this table
09:29 okay
09:31 um now this this one is actually
09:35 about production right so we talked
09:37 earlier in the case study how
09:39 you know based on how much you sell you
09:42 want to start producing enough so that
09:45 you do not
09:47 miss any sales right so you have enough
09:49 product to sell uh
09:51 depending on the customer demand if the
09:52 customer is demanding ten thousand
09:54 then if i have only nine thousand i'm
09:56 going to lose the thousands of sales
09:58 right so so basically i don't want to do
09:60 that so i want to make enough so that i
10:02 can satisfy all the demand that's there
10:04 but i don't want to make too much
10:05 because
10:06 if i make too much then
10:08 that product will lie
10:10 idle as inventory
10:12 either with me or in the regional
10:14 distribution center or somewhere so
10:16 that's also not good
10:18 another thing that is important from a
10:20 production planning perspective is
10:23 you don't want production to go up and
10:25 down ass as much as the variation in
10:28 sales so sales may suddenly peak in one
10:31 month and drop in another month because
10:33 there are many factors like for example
10:35 if there is a
10:36 strike a labor understand
10:40 in a car manufacturer's factory and as
10:43 you all follow the headlines toyota had
10:45 such a major understanding
10:46 2019 for example that they had to shut
10:49 down the factory for a number of months
10:51 so then what happens is suddenly your
10:53 demand from your customer is going to
10:55 drop in one month or it could be a new
10:57 model that's getting launched by that
10:59 that manufacturer and initial months you
11:02 have very high demand right because
11:04 because customers are just trying to get
11:06 their hands on the product uh as quickly
11:08 as they can a recent example is mahindra
11:11 where they introduced the new power
11:13 right the car assuming and the demand is
11:16 so much that even if even if they
11:18 produce for one more year they can't uh
11:21 catch up to the waiting list right so so
11:23 those types of things happen when the
11:25 demand is fluctuating a lot but you
11:27 can't
11:29 flex your production you don't want to
11:31 change your production so rapidly
11:33 because
11:34 then you mean then it means that number
11:36 of labor will be idle for some time and
11:38 suddenly there will be overwork and you
11:40 won't have enough labor so what you want
11:42 is a production that is more smooth it
11:45 should it should be responsive to demand
11:47 but you should not be as much jagged uh
11:49 you know going up and down rapidly like
11:51 the demand so you have a production plan
11:54 that's more smooth
11:56 and follows the sales plan so what you
11:58 see in this table is for all of the 10
12:00 assemblies that we make
12:03 you'll see the
12:05 thing called beginning inventory which
12:07 means at the start of the month how many
12:09 of those products were already in my
12:10 store right finish good store or in my
12:13 warehouse
12:14 and then you see how much was actually
12:16 produced that that month and you see the
12:18 ending inventory which is at the end of
12:20 the month how much products would i have
12:23 on hand at the end of the month so you
12:26 for every single one of those months
12:28 from april 19 to march 21 you see the
12:31 beginning inventory of the gear assembly
12:33 one
12:33 for example you see how much of gear
12:35 assembly one was produced that month and
12:37 then you will see how much of the
12:39 inventory is still lying with me at the
12:41 end of the month
12:43 and i think as you can logically imagine
12:45 the ending inventory that the inventory
12:48 that i have the end of the month
12:49 will be
12:51 equal to how much did i have at the
12:52 beginning how much did i make and then
12:54 how much i sell so logically you can put
12:57 those three things together to find what
12:58 is ending inventory and so similarly you
13:01 will have that data for all the 24
13:02 months for all the 10 products right so
13:05 that's what you see in this particular
13:07 table one thing you see is that
13:09 production does vary so if you look at
13:10 year assembly one
13:12 it we produced 7 000 in april we
13:15 increased to 9000 in may and then we
13:18 kept 9 000 for some months and probably
13:20 then we start decreasing or increasing
13:23 depending on the customer demand so you
13:24 see that it's further
13:26 10 000 in september and so on
13:28 so there is a pattern to this but if you
13:31 see the same gear assembly one in the
13:33 previous table if you see the sales
13:36 if i can go back to the first table in
13:38 the top right
13:42 if you see the sales of vr assembly one
13:44 it was actually 8960 then it fell to
13:47 7960 then it suddenly increased 10 960
13:52 and then
13:53 560 and so on right so you see that
13:56 there's a lot of ups and downs in the
13:58 sales of the of the product uh but
14:01 production is also going up and down but
14:02 it's not going as rapidly up and down
14:05 and this is the job of the what we call
14:08 that the sales and operations planning
14:10 right that we saw in the chart earlier
14:12 which says okay how is my sales going to
14:14 behave and therefore house my production
14:17 should look for each each month so the
14:19 sales and operation planning and the
14:20 market production scheduling which is
14:22 the next step we saw these two
14:24 activities will make sure that we
14:26 produce the right amount
14:28 and that we produce it in a smooth way
14:30 and not so uh up and down as much as the
14:33 sales so shift just for my understanding
14:36 uh
14:37 i mean do i do i understand that each
14:40 gear assembly
14:41 is manufactured by a different machine
14:46 and has different indi as people
14:49 associated with that manufacturing
14:51 because the reason i'm asking that
14:53 question is that we are trying to smooth
14:54 each row and we are not taking the total
14:56 and smoothing the total right
14:59 yes
15:01 that's an excellent question we should
15:03 also be smoothing the overall production
15:05 so that is uh also uh what the mps tries
15:08 to look at like what is the resources
15:10 available so to your question it is all
15:12 shared right it's not dedicated lines um
15:15 you'll see later on that in the
15:17 production scheduling part of the case
15:19 study that the same hobby machine is
15:22 actually used to make two gears two
15:24 different devices
15:26 so yes it is all shared and the
15:30 goal is definitely like you said
15:32 uh
15:33 to smooth not only one product but to
15:36 smooth the entire system
15:38 okay
15:39 so two observations i had uh shiv uh
15:43 first is you know this table that you
15:45 have shown us seems very similar to the
15:48 ledger that we were seeing in the
15:50 e-commerce case
15:52 uh because there what we saw was that
15:55 opening stock plus uh
15:58 incoming goods minus sales was equal to
16:01 closing stock
16:03 and it seems to me at least at first
16:06 glance that you are looking at something
16:07 similarly here right
16:09 except that i would differ the only
16:11 thing is that their incoming can be
16:12 anything
16:14 variation incoming is not a problem
16:16 there but here
16:17 it has to be smooth because for whatever
16:19 we discussed just now production needs
16:21 to be smoother you can't just have
16:23 variability in production
16:25 right right
16:27 the the second
16:29 sort of
16:30 thing that immediately strikes me is
16:32 that if production is smooth and sales
16:35 are sort of variable
16:38 and the amount that i have in my
16:40 warehouse will keep changing constantly
16:44 big swings
16:48 and that that would be another challenge
16:50 perhaps for the warehouse manager to
16:52 manage it
16:54 yes absolutely
16:56 that is very true and that is the role
16:58 the inventory plays cycle inventory is
17:01 both bad and good or good and bad right
17:03 so the bad aspect of inventory is if you
17:05 have a lot of inventory then it's ideal
17:07 products it is locked up capital
17:10 uh it is not actually being used in the
17:12 further in the value chain
17:14 but the good part of inventory is that
17:16 it helps you to do this smoothing
17:18 it
17:19 make sure that you know your sales and
17:21 your production does not exactly match
17:23 your sins because you can dip into the
17:25 inventory when you need more and if
17:27 you're producing more you can add to the
17:28 inventory but as you said rightly the
17:31 inventory is a very
17:34 important thing to manage the store the
17:36 space that is required and the security
17:38 that's required to manage the inventory
17:41 the warehousing
17:42 and sometimes some production like we
17:45 know in the case of vaccines now cold
17:47 cold storage is required not in this in
17:50 this kind of product but those things
17:52 are all part of the inventory management
17:54 is you have the right storage you have
17:56 the right conditions ambient conditions
17:57 for the storage do we have enough
17:60 security and
18:02 control over the inventory so that's
18:04 very important so one of the questions
18:05 that therefore i will have in this is
18:08 how do you manage inventory
18:10 uh from a warehouse manager perspective
18:12 how much
18:13 is the maximum and the minimum uh and
18:16 therefore what is the kind of percentage
18:18 variation i'm having in that inventory
18:20 over the 24 months right um
18:23 so how big a space um should i take
18:26 right like uh or should i you know
18:28 what's the level of variation that
18:30 you've seen that inventory is an
18:31 important question in this
18:35 exercise
18:36 so you have given us uh the inventory
18:39 data as well right
18:41 shifts to
18:43 uh
18:43 and and to me at first glance it seems
18:47 very similar to
18:48 uh
18:50 to the production plan so so what is the
18:53 difference between the two maybe you can
18:55 explain this table and also tell us what
18:57 is the difference from the production
18:58 plan
18:60 yes so the first table we just saw was
19:03 the is that is called the production
19:05 plan for the finished product so think
19:08 of that if you think back on the slide
19:10 we saw there is two stages in this
19:12 production right so first we have to
19:14 take the blanks and we have to make the
19:16 gears
19:17 and then we have to assemble the gears
19:19 together and test and pack and ship it
19:22 so these are the two stages right so
19:24 what you see in this table right here on
19:26 the screen is the finished product
19:28 assembly
19:29 production plan so that means i have to
19:31 make seven thousand assemblies in april
19:34 2019 i think that's what you see there
19:36 right
19:37 but to make 7000 assemblies i need to
19:40 have the two components available
19:43 to make the assembly so what you see in
19:45 the below table is actually the plan for
19:49 the first stage which is how do i make
19:51 the the two gears and how much do i make
19:54 each month so that i can then create the
19:56 assembly in the second stage so what you
19:59 see here is the gears two a two b three
20:02 a three a three b and so on so these are
20:06 the gears actually required to make the
20:07 assemblies
20:09 two three four five and six so we are
20:11 showing the six just for the sake of
20:13 managing the amount of data so for each
20:15 of those assemblies there are two gears
20:18 that are required and what is the
20:19 production plan for those two gears so
20:21 this is how we go level by level right
20:23 we start with how much we produce the
20:24 finished product how much should we
20:26 produce at each of the sub assemblies
20:28 and how much should we produce of each
20:29 of those parts and so on so what you see
20:32 here is the production plan for the
20:35 the individual gears themselves because
20:37 the hobbing and broaching are the two
20:39 steps required to make the individual
20:41 gear and then the assembly is the next
20:43 stage where you put the gears together
20:46 test it and align it in package
20:51 okay
20:53 that
20:54 actually
20:55 then my natural question is what is uh
20:58 what was the term that you used to lift
21:00 material
21:10 yes
21:11 yeah here we are seeing the bill of
21:13 material
21:14 in action right and
21:17 and that should be
21:19 uh
21:20 a little bit of comfort for us perhaps
21:22 because then uh
21:25 from a purchasing perspective i can
21:28 you know it i can smooth out the
21:30 purchases because the same blank is
21:32 being used into uh
21:34 into products
21:36 perhaps hopefully
21:38 absolutely absolutely so you you even if
21:40 you have let's say more demand for 3a
21:43 but at the same month you have less
21:44 demand for 4a
21:46 that means you don't have to change your
21:49 your purchasing of blanks 0 1 1 because
21:52 there will be more use in one place and
21:54 less using another place so the more we
21:55 have common components
21:57 the more you can actually smooth your
22:00 production and make the product
22:02 structure less complex and this is the
22:04 reason that automotive manufacturers go
22:06 for platforms the strategy of platforms
22:08 so if you look at many cars they can be
22:11 built on the same
22:13 platform so for example right now the
22:15 volkswagen group is launching a platform
22:17 called mqb a0 in in india and on top of
22:21 this single platform which uses common
22:25 components in the chassis and common
22:27 engines they can make a suvs they can
22:30 make compact sedans they can make
22:32 midsize sedans they can be
22:34 hatched
22:35 so all of these
22:37 and the strategy behind that is exactly
22:39 this is you have fewer
22:40 components you have fewer assemblies on
22:43 which you can build multiple different
22:45 types of products
22:48 all right very very interesting
22:52 so shim all the other excel sheets have
22:55 the same data right there's no other raw
22:58 data
22:59 yes there is there is one more aspect um
23:02 so here we have seen the scheduled
23:04 production of finished product uh sales
23:06 of finished product then regional sales
23:08 and we saw the production of finished
23:10 products then we saw the production of
23:11 the gears themselves and then there is
23:14 the aspect of uh scheduling which is
23:18 shift by shift how much do i need to
23:20 make
23:23 machine and approaching machine so
23:25 that's the data we haven't probably seen
23:27 it and then there's also data on
23:28 purchasing
23:30 okay
