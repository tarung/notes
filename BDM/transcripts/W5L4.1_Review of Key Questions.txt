00:00 foreign
00:03 [Music]
00:32 that he would like us to answer with
00:35 that data sure let's have a look at
00:37 those questions as well see whether we
00:38 have the same understanding it's very
00:40 important to make sure that we have the
00:41 same understanding of the questions
00:43 right correct because you can multiple
00:45 ways to interpret yes what the question
00:48 is okay so do you want to look at the
00:49 data first or do you want to look at the
00:51 questions first we can maybe look at the
00:54 question maybe look at the questions
00:55 first because the questions first that
00:57 way you can see the data with some okay
00:59 you have a better way to look at what
01:01 what you're looking for in the data
01:02 isn't it that way true yeah true okay
01:04 true so so so what I recall GV is that
01:08 what omkar had said is that there were
01:10 three key stakeholders that he is
01:13 answerable to right one one was the
01:15 planning head uh one was the CFO
01:20 and the third person was the CEO right
01:23 and the planning head I think his job
01:27 was really to get orders to customers as
01:31 fast as possible right he wanted he was
01:34 looking at how to minimize uh delay in
01:37 terms of shipments the CFO had a
01:40 slightly different objective because I
01:42 think the CFO was more worried about
01:43 making sure that you don't hold too much
01:45 inventory not too much Finance is not
01:47 tied up correct correct things like that
01:48 yeah yeah and the CEO was overall
01:51 interested in making sure that the
01:52 business as a whole was growing correct
01:54 yeah so so but I mean that is very high
01:57 I mean
01:58 that is I understand that but
02:01 what are we specifically looking for so
02:03 I think the questions that omkar has
02:05 given us sort of follow from these three
02:08 broad things right okay so if you look
02:12 at what the planning head is looking at
02:13 he wants to know about actually most of
02:17 the questions there are quite a few
02:18 questions from the planning data right
02:19 so first thing he is looking at is what
02:21 are the high volume skills skus stock
02:24 keeping units right and that means what
02:26 so that's an item so it could be as an
02:29 example an Apple iPhone would be our
02:31 iPhone 11 would be an SK iPhone 12 would
02:34 be a different SQ a Samsung M7 would be
02:38 one SKU uh a real me phone would be
02:42 another SKU the things like that like
02:44 what you keep on a store shelf correct
02:46 correct so different shelves you keep
02:48 different things somewhere you keep milk
02:49 somewhere you keep absolutely you just
02:51 get somewhere you keep so each of them
02:53 is an SKU yes and but you're saying now
02:55 that the milk itself there may be three
02:57 different brands of milk each brand is a
02:59 different Escape so not only is each
03:01 brand a different scale if you have a
03:04 half liter packet versus a one liter
03:06 package that's a different Escape so a
03:08 unique way of identifying a specific
03:10 product item that is there on your shelf
03:12 correct yeah but of course this is
03:13 electronic shelf it's not a real it is
03:15 an Electronics yes but nevertheless the
03:17 same concept same concept applies
03:20 so ah what are we saying we want to find
03:22 out so the first thing I think the prime
03:26 plus high volume
03:32 is selling in large numbers large
03:33 numbers because he has to organize his
03:36 entire life there's an assumption here
03:38 the assumption is that uh there are some
03:42 items which are selling in large numbers
03:44 because we don't know we'll find out
03:46 correct correct that is everything is
03:49 nothing correct the answer is not good
03:52 actually yes but there is an assumption
03:53 that some items some items are selling
03:56 typically there too yes typically they
03:57 do in any shop some item will sell like
03:59 if it's a punch or panel cell or if it's
04:02 a vegetable chocolate onion will onions
04:06 and potatoes you know I may buy other
04:09 things but onion potatoes everybody will
04:11 buy onions potatoes and tomatoes right
04:13 yeah okay so there'll be some items that
04:15 will be moving correct so so if you want
04:17 to find out which items are going a lot
04:19 correct and the reason why you want to
04:21 find out is I think I suspect okay uh
04:24 that your Logistics chain has to be
04:26 designed for these items oh I see okay
04:28 because you have to make sure that you
04:30 can remove a lot of these yeah you keep
04:33 so okay that's all you need to know I I
04:35 suspect but we should we should find out
04:37 these items you want management
04:38 attention has to be there on this access
04:40 in terms of logistics correct okay okay
04:42 then all right we'll find out the next
04:44 question that he wants us to ask is one
04:48 is high volume
04:49 uh but which skus are giving a lot of
04:54 Revenue
04:56 and they what will be interesting to see
04:59 is whether these are the same right so
05:01 are the high volume skus may not be
05:04 because it may not be enough yeah
05:06 because you can have a very highly
05:07 expensive item correct which is sold
05:09 even if you sell one you will get a lot
05:11 of money yeah yeah you go to Vietnam
05:14 correct versus if you are selling
05:17 coriander coriander uh
05:20 uh A Team edition high-end TV high on TV
05:25 then you get a lack yeah you get yes
05:27 suddenly you get a big sale correct
05:29 whereas you can buy a lot of
05:31 uh vegetable or some other small two
05:33 rupee coffee pouches I can buy lots of
05:36 them and still you'll never reach one
05:37 like correct isn't it correct so you
05:40 want to find out high volume is one
05:41 thing the other is uh High Revenue okay
05:44 okay which again there's an assumption
05:46 that some items are contributing very
05:47 correct
05:48 correct there is an assumption
05:50 uh
05:52 likely likely right yes okay
05:57 ah what else this third thing and again
05:60 this is I think he's coming from a
06:02 logistics perspective he wants to know
06:05 that there are some items that are high
06:07 volume some items that are high Revenue
06:10 in my warehouse in my fulfillment center
06:14 uh where should I physically place the
06:19 high volume skus where should I place
06:21 the high Revenue skills so that when I'm
06:26 assembling a order for a customer
06:29 how can that order be assembled quickly
06:32 and securely efficiently and securely
06:35 okay securely
06:37 because it's a costly item correct you
06:39 want to it could break it could get
06:41 stolen it could so you have to make sure
06:44 that certain items are protected
06:45 properly and some items are kept uh in a
06:50 place where it is easy to lift and pack
06:52 correct
06:53 okay
06:54 all right so so the next question that
06:58 the planning person is asking is what is
07:01 this sector this question this third
07:03 question
07:07 we are expecting that we'll answer it
07:08 with the same data that we did same
07:10 thing that we did for
07:12 I mean this requires some understanding
07:14 of logistics right no we don't know we
07:17 should ask omkar that actually okay
07:19 so we are saying that with the same
07:21 analysis that we have done we are doing
07:23 we should be or just looking at the
07:25 sales data we should be able to do this
07:26 okay we'll see let's see let's see okay
07:29 um
07:31 the next question uh that we need to
07:33 answer is uh as a planning head
07:37 what skus should I order from my
07:40 supplier study
07:42 today today as in which ones are nearing
07:45 being depleted correct so you want to
07:47 know how much I have yes my what are the
07:50 items that are my warehouse is going to
07:53 get empty today or tomorrow we'll get
07:56 empty so very quickly correct because
07:58 the sales are very high for the item
08:00 or even if sales are not high sales are
08:02 slow
08:03 uh maybe I sell only two units every day
08:07 but I am now down to four units
08:10 of sales correct okay so how many days
08:13 or sales I have sitting in my
08:15 something like that
08:17 and then
08:19 based on that I want to order I will
08:22 place an order on the supplier I have
08:24 lead time over there so I have to order
08:25 an advance also possibly possibly the
08:28 supplier wants if I call him he's not
08:30 going to come and give it to me today
08:31 tomorrow you may you may take even three
08:33 four days it may take some time correct
08:37 so I have to know three days that if
08:39 it's good to take three days to deliver
08:40 I should know three days before that I
08:41 need this okay yes actually many times
08:43 when you click go and place an order the
08:45 shopkeeper will tell you you know sir if
08:48 you place an order I'll get it to you
08:49 after three days I think that's what's
08:51 going on there it's not there in his
08:53 Warehouse so he has to get it from
08:54 somewhere
08:55 correct
08:60 Okay so
09:02 I see okay so you need to know when to
09:04 order
09:05 all right yes
09:06 and I hope you have data for all this
09:08 okay we'll see I don't know I think we
09:11 should take a look at the data all right
09:12 okay uh the next question the planning
09:15 head wants to know is is there a trend
09:18 and I think why the trend is necessary
09:20 uh is basically that will help him plan
09:23 right so is there a trend in terms of
09:26 volumes as an example yeah is there some
09:29 unit where is it Trend it means that
09:31 it's consistently going up or
09:34 consistently going down or orders are
09:37 high on Saturdays I see I see something
09:39 you know some Trend some pattern some
09:42 pattern some pattern across this across
09:44 time across time across time so it could
09:47 be a repeating pattern it would be
09:49 increasing decreasing something correct
09:50 all right it could be across months it
09:52 could be across weeks it could be across
09:54 days okay
09:56 so that's called Trend okay so uh which
10:00 is useful for basically preparing so
10:03 let's say we have a lot of sales on
10:04 Saturday Sunday
10:05 then you prepare for Saturday Sunday
10:07 like that okay uh if you find basically
10:10 that uh Monday there is a usually a lean
10:14 day
10:14 for the shop you might do some other
10:17 activities on that day so you know the
10:19 other thing I think people also do I
10:21 know this is that you know they would
10:23 give their staff in the shop a day off
10:26 because
10:37 it's not a heavy day correct correct
10:39 things like that you can plan okay okay
10:41 you probably don't want to plan your
10:44 staff having a holiday on Saturday if
10:45 there are a lot of orders
10:48 yeah
10:49 I understand
10:50 uh so link to that I think is the next
10:54 question which days have the highest
10:55 sale right these days which days of the
10:59 week I'm assuming right here the
11:01 question is I'm I'm assuming we should
11:03 ask home carpet yeah uh and then the
11:07 next two questions are somewhat related
11:09 which items should I stock more which
11:12 item should I stock less then some items
11:14 are moving a lot correct and there's a
11:17 lot of demand some items don't have so
11:19 much demand so I can't stop talking
11:22 the second question which is also more
11:24 interesting is where should I stock
11:26 these items Ah that's the various
11:28 Warehouse question is correct no no
11:29 optimization so should I stock it in
11:32 Madras should I stock it in Kochi should
11:35 I stock it in Hyderabad it has to be
11:37 local
11:38 yeah yeah so you demand in Chennai
11:41 correct should be served from Chennai
11:44 because then you can serve it faster
11:46 like I guess
11:48 generally I mean in this space in
11:50 e-commerce especially if you can't find
11:52 the order you will probably not buy it
11:53 from you or you'll go yeah you'll go
11:55 from here to Amazon or some other
11:57 correct total and bite there correct so
12:00 you must be able to fulfill the demand
12:02 yes which means that you have to stock
12:05 locally yes as far as possible okay
12:09 yeah there are some items I guess rare
12:11 items where people may be willing to
12:12 wait a little bit a few no right mostly
12:15 they want it
12:21 yeah
12:22 okay yeah
12:25 so the next set of questions is coming
12:27 from the CFO Okay and like we said the
12:30 CFO is most worried about
12:32 uh
12:35 how much capital is he locking up
12:37 in inventory and yes and therefore so
12:42 because inventory is expensive yes of
12:45 course we are assuming that the company
12:46 buys the it keeps it may not be it may
12:48 not be but but still some of it I guess
12:51 if nothing else you are occupying space
12:53 right so you are paying for the space
12:55 you're true very true you're paying for
12:57 the space so how much inventory are you
12:60 holding is it necessary to hold that
13:01 budget okay but he is also he doesn't
13:05 want revenue losses right so he also
13:08 wants to know are there situations when
13:10 the or customer ordered something
13:13 but that item was not available in my
13:16 warehouse
13:17 so I ordered a phone or customer ordered
13:19 a phone but I didn't have this phone in
13:21 my warehouse which is called a stock
13:23 order that is called a stock so stock
13:24 out basically means there's no stock
13:26 there is no stock right so customer
13:28 wants something yeah but there is no
13:30 stock in my way so if you type if you go
13:31 to Amazon or something you type you'll
13:33 say not available currently unavailable
13:36 so that's a server yes or if you go to
13:39 yourself get very upset or or if you go
13:41 to your local shoe shop that guy will
13:43 tell you sir I don't have you come
13:45 tomorrow I will get it for you yeah
13:48 I'll deliver it to your house right
13:50 right that's a stock out really
13:53 no but there in that case in the shoe
13:55 shop you can't have so much shoes anyway
13:56 correct can only have limited number of
13:59 models receive a catalog correct right
14:01 correct
14:02 but here but what he knows what he knows
14:04 is that that item is available in
14:06 somewhere else he knows that that
14:08 information here and that information
14:10 actually I think omkar also has ah if it
14:14 is not available in Chennai he knows it
14:16 is available in Hyderabad so he can take
14:18 the order correct and deliver it correct
14:20 it may come until later correct
14:22 all right
14:24 yeah the final question and this seems
14:28 to be a very data specific question so
14:30 we should find out why the CF was asking
14:33 this question he's asking why are we not
14:35 getting stocks on sku m01
14:40 so so there is a mobile SKU m01
14:45 uh and what I recall from the data and
14:48 let us look at the data but what I
14:50 recall from the data is that there is
14:52 demand but supply seems to be a little
14:54 bit of a problem
14:55 so I think that is what the CFO is
14:58 asking that's very specific all right
14:59 yeah okay
15:03 so the CEO wants to look at growth right
15:09 and his questions are very very growth
15:11 oriented
15:12 the first question he is asking is
15:15 if there is a customer from Chennai do
15:18 places an order what percentage of the
15:21 orders that a customer from Chennai
15:23 faced places are fulfilled from the
15:25 Chennai Warehouse
15:27 it's called a forward this year okay so
15:30 a forward TC is basically a distribution
15:33 center which is near which is near the
15:36 customer so so what omkar if you recall
15:39 what he had told us in the last lecture
15:40 is that Hyderabad is the Hub okay or the
15:44 mother Distribution Center okay and
15:47 Madras and Kochi are forward forward
15:50 DC's okay so if a m if a customer from
15:54 terminal Valley or a customer from
15:57 Chennai places in order it will it
15:60 should in theory get fulfilled by The
16:02 Madras DC and if it is if there is no
16:05 stock in mattress DC it will go to
16:07 Hyderabad
16:08 okay
16:10 but ideally
16:12 a very high percentage of the orders
16:14 being placed from Chennai should be
16:17 fulfilled from the Chennai DC because
16:19 then you are able to do one day
16:20 turnaround two-day turnaround kind of
16:22 thing for which you need to have a good
16:24 idea of the kind of orders you're
16:25 getting from this region right correct
16:27 so over a period of time you can collect
16:29 the data and this and do something okay
16:31 all right this second question I think
16:34 the CEO wants to ask is uh you know
16:37 omkar mentioned that he had three bu's
16:40 they had a lifestyle bu they had a
16:44 consumables View at FMC GPU and they had
16:48 a mobile Speedo okay and the CEO wants
16:51 to know which bu is growing fast okay
16:54 which is this is the one that is growing
16:56 correct okay
16:57 and the third one is uh you know how do
17:01 you plan service levels for important
17:03 escape's right yeah
17:06 it's as in uh how many days you should
17:09 you should correct how do you make sure
17:12 that for these important skus 98 of the
17:16 time you can get one day delivery here I
17:18 think mobile phone he said your current
17:20 sentence you don't do it they don't buy
17:21 it correct correct there are some things
17:23 like fashion or something people are
17:25 willing to wait maybe willing to wait
17:26 yeah yeah
