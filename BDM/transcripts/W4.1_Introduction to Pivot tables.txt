00:18 introduction to Pivot tables so far
00:20 we've done a lot of we've looked at this
00:24 data for quite some time and we've
00:26 looked at interesting ways of analyzing
00:29 this data
00:30 but there are
00:32 lots of things that we seem to be having
00:35 to do manually right so
00:38 let me
00:40 ask a very simple question how many CS
00:43 students got an A Grade remember we did
00:47 countif and using countif we were able
00:51 to figure out that ah
00:55 here is what we did
00:57 and let me do that again
01:00 so I said countif
01:04 and
01:24 and then I should do this as absolute
01:40 okay so I know how many students got any
01:43 I know how many students got a B how
01:46 many students got to see how many
01:47 students got a deal right
01:49 uh first of all I needed to do this in a
01:53 very painful way I needed to first know
01:55 that students could only get a b c d
01:58 uh and more importantly there is no
02:00 elegant way of extending this right so
02:02 if I wanted to figure out uh how many CS
02:06 students got any
02:08 okay
02:09 or how many ECE students got a BC
02:12 how many godavari students got any okay
02:16 I want to analyze by hostel there are
02:19 very many different ways in which I may
02:21 choose to analyze uh this data
02:25 by looking at correlations between
02:28 different fields right each of these
02:32 columns is called a field
02:33 and each row is called a data item so I
02:38 want to look at correlations between
02:40 these data fields and that is going to
02:44 be very very challenging if I have to do
02:47 it by hand
02:48 now the good thing is that Excel has
02:50 given us a very very powerful tool and I
02:53 want you guys to understand this tool
02:56 very carefully because
02:59 80 percent of what you are going to
03:01 learn in this course is just going to be
03:03 pivot tables right so the tool is called
03:06 pivot table
03:08 and what the pivot table allows you to
03:10 do is to explore correlations between uh
03:14 different uh Fields uh
03:19 as we uh
03:21 that are available in the data set so
03:24 first thing you do is you pick the data
03:27 that you want to analyze so I want to
03:28 analyze the data that I have selected
03:30 here right so I'm going to analyze this
03:34 table
03:35 and
03:36 insert a pivot table
03:39 right
03:41 so I say from this data and it's picked
03:45 up the data that I want which is a
03:48 dollar a dollar two up to Dollar K
03:51 dollar 32
03:52 and I'm gonna put this analysis in a new
03:55 worksheet
03:58 okay
03:60 so a pivot table
04:02 consists of uh
04:05 four sort of broad areas it's got rows
04:09 it's got columns and it's got values and
04:12 then it's got something called filters
04:13 which will come to later okay so it
04:15 looks very much like a worksheet except
04:18 that it is a worksheet that I have
04:20 created by looking at data in another
04:22 worksheet right so let's first ask the
04:25 question how many CS students how many
04:27 EC students do we have
04:29 so for that what we do is we say I want
04:33 rows to be Department right so what do
04:37 we get here the moment I dragged the
04:40 field rows
04:41 so this is called a pivot table designer
04:44 you drag
04:46 a field from this list of fields into
04:49 rows you can see that now I have two
04:52 rows Cs and EC
04:56 and what do I want here I want the
04:58 number of students who have this
05:00 department right so I'm going to drag
05:03 roll number here
05:05 and some funny thing came up right so
05:08 what this is now showing me is the sum
05:11 of the Roll numbers of students who have
05:14 CS Department which is not what I want I
05:17 want this summarized by count because I
05:21 want to know how many
05:23 students
05:25 have what is the number of count of roll
05:29 numbers where the students department is
05:32 CS
05:33 so that is what this design here is
05:36 showing me
05:37 the rows are departments and the values
05:41 are count of roll number
05:44 okay
05:46 now I want to know I could do more
05:48 things right I could do let us say
05:52 uh
05:55 how many instead of looking at how many
05:59 students in a department so there are
06:02 totally 30 but I want to look at grades
06:05 okay so if I say how many grades are
06:08 there a b c d and count of roll number
06:12 will tell me how many students have an A
06:14 how many students have a b how many
06:15 students have a c how many students have
06:17 a d and again you can see that this is
06:21 exactly the same calculation sorry that
06:24 I had done here using
06:26 countif but now I was able to do this
06:30 far more easily right similarly if I go
06:35 back and instead of doing this ah
06:39 if I just did the department thing
06:44 I've got 14 in CS and 16 in EC remember
06:49 we had done the same thing with filters
06:51 right we had done this with
06:54 filters
06:56 so I could say
06:60 if I just said CS
07:04 and then selected this
07:07 you can see here that this 14
07:10 same thing if I did instead of Cs I did
07:13 ECE
07:16 then I've got 16. so again this was
07:19 something that I could have done with
07:20 filters but it would have been very
07:22 difficult to do I would have to keep a
07:24 lot of track of data manually here using
07:29 an Excel sheet I am able to do using a
07:31 pivot table I am able to do it almost
07:33 automatically right
07:35 now
07:37 I want to know how many students are
07:41 there in
07:43 each hostel right so I could do that as
07:46 well
07:53 hey but I don't want hostile number
07:54 right I want hostile name
07:59 so
08:01 godavari has eight students kaveri has
08:04 five sarayu has six yamuna has eleven
08:08 and I think we don't have any students
08:10 from
08:13 which hostel one hostel we don't seem to
08:16 have any students right
08:18 let me clear the filter so we don't have
08:21 any students from kaveri Maybe yeah no
08:24 we've got students from kaveri uh
08:27 godavari kaveriu yamuna
08:32 oh yeah that's because we've messed
08:35 around with this so let's redo this
08:38 okay so now
08:41 the data here is changed right
08:44 the pivot table will not have changed
08:46 what you need to do is go and right
08:49 click so if the underlying data changes
08:51 the pivot table doesn't change
08:53 automatically what you need to do is to
08:55 go into the pivot table area
08:57 right click
08:59 and you will see a option called refresh
09:03 if you refresh the pivot table now you
09:05 see that we have eight students from
09:08 Ganga three from yamuna 6 from sarayu
09:12 five from kaveri and eight from godavari
09:15 right
09:16 and as data changes uh it is now I no
09:20 longer need to do any manual calculation
09:22 again and again
09:24 uh
09:26 and keep you know so pivot tables will
09:29 do it all automatically for me
09:33 now
09:35 having done that much I now want to
09:38 figure out
09:40 how many students are there in godavari
09:44 from Department
09:47 from each department right now there are
09:50 two ways that I can do this okay one is
09:52 that I can just drag this department
09:55 field
09:56 into rows under
09:59 hostel
10:01 so now what is this data telling me
10:03 godavari has a total of eight students
10:06 out of which four are from CS and four
10:09 are from ECE
10:12 right
10:13 kaveri has five
10:15 out of which
10:17 one is from CS and four are from EC
10:20 sorry you there are again six students
10:23 two are from CS and four are from EC
10:26 yamuna doesn't seem to have any easy
10:28 students it has three ECS students and
10:31 ganga has four each from CS and EC
10:34 but this is not a very nice way of
10:37 looking at it right what I would have
10:38 really liked is a table in which rows
10:41 are hostels and columns are departments
10:44 and that is where this third area in
10:47 Excel sheet in the work pivot table
10:49 comes from so instead of dragging
10:51 Department under rows let's say a drag
10:54 Department into columns
10:57 and
10:58 voila you can see what happened so now
11:01 this tells us very clearly in godavari
11:04 we have four CS students and four EC
11:06 students
11:07 in kaveri we have 1 and 4
11:10 we have two and four in yamuna 3 and 0
11:14 and ganga 4 and 4. now I could do other
11:17 things right instead of looking at
11:19 uh Department I could say
11:23 you know which hostel has done the best
11:27 in terms of great
11:30 right and while this may be a boring
11:32 thing to look at just imagine you could
11:34 be doing the same calculation on let us
11:37 say the results of a sports meet and you
11:39 want to know which hostel won the
11:41 general Championship right
11:43 so you can see that
11:46 only one student got an A and she was in
11:49 godavari
11:51 five students in godavari got a B and
11:56 two got a D so out of the eight students
11:59 in godavari uh
12:01 one got a a five got B's and two got
12:05 these
12:08 kaveri
12:09 uh four students got to be
12:12 one got and one got a C
12:14 Sarah you five got a B and one got a C
12:18 yamuna one got a B and two got C's and
12:22 ganga five B's two C's and One D okay so
12:27 you've got now a picture of how you can
12:30 get grades uh you can I could have as an
12:34 example instead of hostel I could have
12:36 just gotten grades by Department as well
12:39 right
12:40 so it tells you that once year student
12:43 got an A no ECE student got a
12:47 but a lot of EC students seem to have
12:50 got uh
12:51 Beach right the bulk of VC students 14
12:54 out of 16 have got Beats so so
12:58 a lot of analysis a lot of data Cuts you
13:02 are able to get
13:04 uh almost for free once you've built a
13:07 pivot table you're able to drag data
13:09 around
13:11 and play around
13:13 right so this is a very very powerful
13:17 Tool uh I would encourage you to get
13:20 very comfortable with this tool
13:23 uh now let's look at something more
13:26 right
13:27 let's look at uh
13:31 if I look at
13:34 I want to know how many CS students are
13:37 there
13:37 and what is the split of grades by
13:41 hostel okay so notice here that you've
13:45 got departments all and I'm not
13:47 interested in all departments so this x
13:50 fourth region here in the design is
13:52 called a filter suppose I want to look
13:55 only at CS students okay
13:57 so
13:58 I could say
14:01 only show me CS
14:04 okay
14:06 and now if I say only CS
14:09 then it's showing me oh I have taken
14:13 hostile number I should not have taken
14:15 hostile number I should have taken
14:16 Hospital name
14:18 so it's showing me
14:20 the breakup of hostile name versus
14:24 grades
14:26 right so any sort of cut I can play
14:30 around uh
14:32 so a very very powerful very rich Tool
14:37 uh bulk of our conversation in this
14:41 course is going to be taking large data
14:44 sets and analyzing it using pivot tables
14:48 I would therefore encourage you to get
14:51 very comfortable play around with data
14:54 sets
14:55 that will be given to you and see how
14:60 you can understand the data
15:05 end of segment three
