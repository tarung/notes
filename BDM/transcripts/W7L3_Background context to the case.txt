00:00 [Music]
00:16 uh
00:18 you know you spoke about some of this
00:20 but uh the other
00:23 interesting question i think is you know
00:25 kovit has sort of dominated the last 15
00:28 months in terms of news right
00:31 so how did and we spent the e-commerce
00:34 case actually covered
00:35 sort of
00:37 increased demand for e-commerce uh how
00:40 how has cobit affected the automotive
00:43 sector
00:45 yes um that is uh that is a great
00:47 question and actually it has been um
00:50 quite uh
00:51 a major
00:53 impact for the industry right negative
00:55 impact um due to coverage so if you
00:57 looked at how it developed right um
00:59 right around the end of march
01:02 most of the activity in the country shut
01:04 down with respect to manufacturing and
01:06 there was a migration of labor in april
01:08 and may of 2020 away from the
01:11 manufacturing clusters and the cities
01:14 back to the um their homes and and
01:17 so on so so there were multiple impacts
01:20 due to this one was the disposable
01:22 income
01:24 of people to actually buy automobiles
01:26 like new cars etc and and the
01:28 willingness to buy right even if you
01:30 have the income of the
01:31 money to buy but the
01:33 uh
01:34 the the
01:35 you know the demand also depends on the
01:37 willingness to buy and all of that
01:39 dropped very sharply in the first half
01:41 of the financial year 2021. so you see
01:44 the demand for the finished products
01:46 dipped a lot um and that then meant that
01:49 there was inventory lying in different
01:51 parts of the valley chain another thing
01:53 that happened was because of the
01:54 migration of the labor away from the
01:56 manufacturing clusters such as pune or
01:58 chennai and so on
01:60 uh even if the companies could even when
02:02 they could reopen their factories they
02:04 found it very difficult to actually get
02:06 this labor back right and then get back
02:09 to the full fledged kind of supply and
02:12 uh in the second half of the year things
02:14 actually started to normalize and you
02:16 started to see production sort of pick
02:18 up and you even saw a real sharp spike
02:21 because there was some makeup pile right
02:23 people who couldn't buy or go out for
02:25 long they actually went and got more
02:27 more cars around
02:29 the festive season and so on so so you
02:31 see a very turbulent year in 2020 for
02:34 the
02:35 entire industry and then again towards
02:37 the end of the financial year we had the
02:38 second wave starting to come up and that
02:41 again was a dent on the industry so you
02:44 will see that and then even the
02:45 suppliers such as asps had to go through
02:48 a similar
02:50 sort of ups and downs uh as you will see
02:52 so in the case study you will actually
02:54 see
02:55 two years because we want to illustrate
02:56 all these phenomena right from
02:59 april 1st 2019 you will see the data for
03:02 24 months all the way till uh may march
03:05 31st 2021
03:08 and so in these two years you'll see
03:10 both the bs4 to be a sixth transition in
03:12 the first first year you'll see that the
03:14 second year you'll see all the impact
03:16 that was caused
03:20 uh gb would the students know what is
03:22 financial or should we explain it here
03:25 worth explaining i think what is the
03:27 financial year what's the difference
03:28 between calendar year and financially
03:31 yeah that's uh that's a great point so
03:32 india traditionally has had a financial
03:36 year
03:37 and that's also true for our government
03:38 our tax filings and everything that
03:40 starts on april 1st of one year and goes
03:43 to march 31st next year so when when we
03:47 talk about uh financial year 2021 it
03:50 means the period of time from april 1st
03:53 2020 to march 31st 2021.
03:56 sometimes in short it's just called
03:58 financial year 21 which is a little bit
04:00 illogical but because it's only the
04:03 three years have come in 2021 but
04:05 usually we always go by
04:07 the the finishing year is more important
04:09 so anyway we will for simplicity we'll
04:11 talk about this 20 20 21 but if you look
04:14 at the calendar year that's what a lot
04:16 of companies in the western world use
04:19 it's just basically january 1st to
04:21 december 31st of each year right so
04:24 calendar year 2020 is january 1 202
04:27 december 31 2020
04:29 and financial year uh 20
04:32 hyphen 21 is april 1st 2020 to march
04:36 31st 2021.
04:39 okay so
04:41 may also uh i know you alluded to this
04:44 uh shiv but
04:46 this bs4 bs6 of course i've seen some of
04:49 it as an example on
04:51 buses it says uh very often bs4
04:54 compliant or trucks will save years for
04:56 compliance
04:57 but it'd be useful i think to explain to
04:60 our students what is what exactly is
05:02 believed for obvious speaks
05:05 yes um that is a fantastic
05:08 question um so so as you as you know um
05:12 if you look at um a few years before
05:15 right we have some of the worst
05:16 pollution
05:17 uh in places like delhi um that has ever
05:20 been recorded and even going back 10
05:22 years we we saw that pollution in the
05:24 country was increasing as it was getting
05:26 more urbanized there was more
05:27 construction activity there was other
05:30 activities such as
05:31 you know how the crops are dispositioned
05:33 there's activity around
05:36 you know automobiles and so on so the
05:38 government decided to improve the
05:40 emission norm so emission norms are how
05:42 much emission
05:44 uh an automobile is allowed to have
05:46 right so that that's what it guides they
05:48 want to increase emission norms step by
05:51 step and quickly catch up with the uh
05:53 what's prevailing in some of the
05:55 modern
05:56 advanced countries like what is in
05:58 western europe and and they have done a
06:00 remarkable job in quickly
06:02 uh ushering in bs6 so what if you look
06:06 at the diesel that is where you see the
06:08 stock differences in the allowed
06:09 emission norms for bs4 to be a six right
06:13 so if you look at um that table that
06:15 talks about uh the diesel engines under
06:17 the ps4
06:19 regime they were allowed to have
06:22 hydrocarbons and
06:24 nox emissions up to 300 milligrams per
06:27 kilometer
06:28 and in bf6
06:29 they can only have up to 170 milligrams
06:32 of 43 reduction if you look at nox
06:36 itself which is nitrous oxide which is a
06:37 very poisonous gas that comes from the
06:40 emissions of the cars right
06:42 that's the stock decrease that has been
06:44 mandated so from 250
06:47 milligrams a kilometer
06:51 it was reduced only up to 80 milligrams
06:53 of kilometers allowed in the ps6
06:56 cars or trucks right
06:58 cars basically and then particulate
07:01 matter is another one
07:03 again from 25 milligrams per kilometer
07:06 that was possible are allowed in the ps4
07:09 vehicles
07:10 um it was starkly reduced 82
07:13 to 4.5 milligrams only allowed per
07:16 kilometer if you see in the petrol the
07:18 the changes are not that
07:20 that big because um already petrol
07:23 engines were less in nox and pm uh
07:27 what's remarkable is if you see the bs6
07:30 right the diesel engines are almost as
07:33 good as petrol when it comes to
07:35 knocks
07:36 and particulate matters so so this is
07:39 the this is the basis of the transition
07:41 from bs4 to bs6
07:44 and this sort of helps me
07:47 understand and appreciate if i remember
07:50 10 years ago you know some of these
07:52 trucks and buses
07:54 used to give out so much black smoke
07:56 and now uh in most of the diesel cars
07:59 you can't really see that much smoke
08:01 coming out right i think it's because
08:04 a lot of that has been cleaned up
08:08 is that is that correct
08:10 yes absolutely there is a number of
08:11 mechanisms that have been incorporated
08:13 in the bs-6 vehicles
08:16 there is a nox trap which is a way in
08:19 which the nitrous excess nitrous oxide
08:21 is actually burnt off
08:24 when the vehicle is actually going at a
08:25 high speed or a good steady speed um and
08:29 there's also urea treatment that happens
08:31 to the emissions
08:32 that reduces some of the emissions so
08:35 the technology in the bs6 diesel engines
08:38 is actually quite remarkable you can see
08:40 the
08:41 the drastic reduction that we see in
08:44 knox and pm um and um and so
08:48 it has been a little bit of a rough
08:50 change for the industry initially
08:51 because they have to then uh
08:54 change a number of things with the
08:55 engine the transmission and the
08:56 production
08:58 treatment of the exhaust treatment
08:60 systems in the car
09:01 but now it is bearing fruit because
09:05 now i think people can actually feel
09:06 less guilty about driving
09:08 diesel vehicles i myself do when i drive
09:11 my diesel suv but uh yes it is it did
09:15 cause some disruption when the
09:16 transition was going on but in the end
09:18 we have much cleaner vehicles um today
09:21 uh it's almost to the point that if you
09:23 look at the overall composition of what
09:25 the diesel does versus the petrol dust
09:27 it's
09:29 even in the carbon monoxide the diesel
09:31 was always more efficient because the
09:33 efficiency of the diesel engine it
09:35 produced less carbon monoxide per
09:38 kilometer so if you look at per
09:39 kilometer
09:41 in almost everything except hydrocarbon
09:43 uh diesel is actually almost as good as
09:45 petrol or better in some areas
09:48 very very interesting
09:51 we already i think we spoke about this
09:54 right chief
09:55 yes
09:58 okay so
10:00 uh
10:01 you know
10:02 one of the things you mentioned and that
10:04 sort of was overwhelming for me is the
10:06 number of departments uh
10:09 you know
10:11 in a factory
10:13 so
10:14 maybe
10:15 you can explain to us how do all of
10:17 these departments work together you know
10:19 what are the kinds of
10:20 uh
10:22 systems what are the kind of processes
10:24 uh
10:25 who holds all of this together
10:28 yeah that's a fantastic question and
10:30 this slide should uh should help us um
10:33 to sort of talk through that right so if
10:35 you if you look at um
10:37 uh earlier we talked about how planning
10:39 was so important in the in this industry
10:41 or in almost every manufacturing
10:43 industry it is really really important
10:45 and the way planning works is that you
10:47 want to make sure the right amount of
10:49 resources are available at the right
10:51 time
10:53 to enable the production
10:55 of the product that you're making right
10:57 and when you talk about resources you
10:59 know manufacturing industry has multiple
11:01 types of resources there is material
11:03 resources that means you have to have
11:05 the raw materials that are available to
11:07 start the production process or the or
11:09 the semi-finished products
11:11 available to start the next stage of the
11:12 production process there is human
11:14 resources which is about the the
11:17 the people that are required to operate
11:19 the the machine lines and so on there is
11:22 financial resources which means you have
11:23 to have the cash to actually pay the
11:25 supplier to get the product and so on um
11:29 and and and so on so all of these
11:31 resources have to be planned
11:33 so that the right amount of resources
11:35 available so if you
11:36 if we spend too much to acquire too many
11:39 resources then your money is locked up
11:41 right and essentially that is good but
11:43 if you have two less resources then you
11:46 cannot do a particular step in that
11:48 production and so
11:50 all of the other resources will lie
11:52 ideal right
11:53 like it's a waste right you can't
11:54 actually create the product and ship it
11:56 to the customer
11:57 so the whole planning process is uh is
11:60 around making sure the right amount of
12:02 resources are available at the right
12:03 time and if you want to really do that
12:06 well
12:07 you have to go top down right so that's
12:09 what this whole
12:11 slide is showing so you have to plan at
12:13 a strategic level
12:15 year on year what is the this is going
12:17 to do so for example if you have to
12:19 create
12:20 if you have if you think that in two
12:21 years your demand will be twice what you
12:23 have today right the number of products
12:26 your customer want is going to be twice
12:28 then you may need to set up a new
12:29 factory so those are called long-range
12:32 planning decisions that's the strategic
12:34 business plan that's at the top right so
12:36 the ceo the cfo the ceo of the company
12:40 or means the heads of different parts of
12:42 the company may sit together and say
12:44 let's create a strategic business plan
12:46 that says overall what is going to be
12:48 our products where is it going to go
12:51 we need
12:52 from there
12:53 very quickly you have to come to what
12:54 happens month by month within a year
12:57 right so once i know that 2022 is going
12:59 to be strategically i don't know 1
13:01 million units of product that i need to
13:03 make i need to then say
13:05 what do i need to make in january
13:06 february march and so on because there
13:08 could be some seasonality as the festive
13:10 season comes a few months before that i
13:13 may need to make more so that my
13:15 end uh
13:17 my customers were then creating products
13:19 for the end customer is able to make
13:21 more in that time so that is what
13:24 happens in the sales and operations plan
13:27 so the sales and operation plan is the
13:29 one that marries the sales plan with the
13:31 production problem at a high level so
13:34 the sales guys come and say look i can
13:36 sell
13:37 uh one and a half million not one
13:38 billion next year
13:41 then the production guys have to ramp up
13:42 for that right so the sales and
13:44 production people have to sit together
13:46 and say okay what is realistically
13:48 possible that i have to plan month by
13:50 month which is basically sales and
13:52 operations plan so usually you'll have
13:53 the same set there you'll have the
13:55 production head there you'll have the
13:57 financing there in that
13:59 planning phase
14:00 now we may do that for 2022 today right
14:04 but when i get into 2022 there are going
14:06 to be things that happen month by month
14:08 that is going to change my outlook let's
14:11 say the comic completely vanishes very
14:13 positive scenario right and then
14:15 everybody wants to buy and people are
14:17 out there wanting to buy lots of new
14:19 cars next year now that i may not have
14:22 forecast i might have said one and a
14:23 half million parts but when i actually
14:26 come there i find that it's even more
14:28 than that or less than that now i have
14:30 to do month by month planning as i get
14:32 close to the month right that is the
14:34 master production trigger so that says
14:37 very
14:38 very close by uh next two three months
14:41 what is going to be my production
14:42 schedule how much capacity do i need how
14:45 much materials i need etcetera that's
14:47 month by month
14:48 so that's again done usually by the
14:50 production head
14:52 the sales head and so on and then you
14:54 have
14:55 the material requirement plan which is
14:57 almost on a weekly basis
14:59 and sometimes it's even run on a daily
15:01 basis to say okay i know how much i need
15:04 to make this week
15:05 i know how much labor i have
15:07 how much material i have i know how much
15:09 raw material and
15:11 work in progress i have and i know how
15:13 much i need to make this week
15:16 let me now run
15:18 a routine or a program to actually
15:21 actually spit out exactly how much you
15:23 need to make
15:25 every single day of this week right so
15:27 that's a material requirement plan and
15:29 also it will spit out how much you need
15:30 to order
15:31 uh with your supplier for some of your
15:33 raw materials
15:35 similar to that is the capacity
15:36 requirement plan so both mrp and crp are
15:40 mostly by the production head the human
15:42 resources head the procurement head and
15:45 so on because they are trying to figure
15:46 out how much i need to make on a shift
15:49 day by day kind of basis and how much
15:51 capacity i have for that so the capacity
15:53 requirement plan also says i might
15:55 actually need to get more contract labor
15:58 or i might need to send out some parts
15:60 to a contract supplier because i don't
16:02 have capacity this week so those things
16:04 happen in the capacity requirement plan
16:06 and then finally on a shift-by-shift
16:08 basis a shift is actually eight usually
16:11 eight hours of production so many
16:13 factories in this case ace runs three
16:15 shifts so they run a morning shift uh an
16:18 evening shift and a night shift and on
16:20 that particular shift you have to decide
16:22 exactly which machines are going to be
16:24 loaded which machines are going to go
16:26 under maintenance how much product do i
16:28 need to make in machine x and why and
16:31 how much labor do i assign to that
16:33 machine so that's a detailed production
16:35 schedule
16:37 and and production activity control then
16:39 is controlling that chevron it's making
16:41 sure that what you actually plan to make
16:43 that shift you did make is it efficient
16:45 enough do you need to mean do you need
16:47 proactive maintenance to make sure that
16:49 the machine is running better next shift
16:51 and so on so that comes now to uh that
16:55 and then the purchasing plan ultimately
16:56 which is managed by purchasing and
16:58 finance is uh is aligned with the mrp
17:01 material requirement plan and just
17:03 talking about how much do i order today
17:05 tomorrow and so on with my suppliers so
17:08 you can see the whole thing is coming
17:09 from multiple years to multiple months
17:12 to multiple weeks to multiple
17:14 days to multiple shifts and to one shift
17:17 and then machines within that shift kind
17:19 of thing so that's why the time phase it
17:22 comes from uh top down it comes from a
17:25 wide time gap down to a narrow time gap
17:27 as we go through the planning process
17:32 so so as you go down this uh down the
17:36 spot you're basically paying attention
17:38 to more and more details is that right
17:41 yes absolutely you're getting more
17:43 detail within a smaller time bucket
17:46 you have more information on what is
17:48 actually happening and so you can be
17:50 more granular in your plan
17:53 and that from our course perspective
17:55 basically means more and more data is
17:57 being generated more and more data has
17:59 been captured and
18:01 more work for us to do in terms of
18:03 analysis right
18:04 absolutely
18:05 yeah
18:06 okay
18:07 yeah makes sense
18:13 okay so this team's uh
18:17 can you can you just help us understand
18:19 what this is
18:21 yes um so um this is what you'll see a
18:25 lot of the data in your spreadsheets is
18:26 around this picture so you can use this
18:28 picture as a backup reference as you go
18:31 through some of this data you will you
18:33 will keep looking at this picture many
18:34 times um what this is is called a bill
18:37 of materials so so it is not a bill that
18:40 you pay in a restaurant or whatever it's
18:42 it's a term that's the production
18:43 industry is always used to denote
18:46 how the structure of the tree structure
18:49 of the product is made up of so as a
18:52 company what i'm selling to my customer
18:54 is at the top right they are called
18:55 finished products so i am selling 10
18:58 different gear assemblies and this slide
19:00 shows uh
19:02 five of them that is actually full time
19:04 it won't be fitting into a single slide
19:07 but
19:08 those are called the finished products
19:09 at the top right those are things that
19:10 we sell to the customer now to make uh
19:13 gear assembly two for example i actually
19:16 need a
19:17 sub so these these are the finished
19:20 products right these
19:22 yes those are the finished products gear
19:24 assembly two three four five six there's
19:26 also one seven eight nine and ten which
19:29 is not there in this picture but those
19:31 are the finished product then we should
19:34 talk about sub assemblies a sum assembly
19:36 is something that's used
19:39 at the next level of the finished
19:41 product so for example gear assemblies 2
19:43 is made of two
19:44 gears
19:45 gear 2a and 2b so as you saw that
19:49 picture two of these gears have to be
19:50 put together to make gear assembly too
19:52 so these individual gears are called
19:55 sometimes they're called semi-finished
19:56 products sometimes i call work in
19:58 progress sometimes they are called
20:01 components and so on
20:03 but you can you can imagine right now to
20:05 make ear to a i actually start with a
20:09 raw material which is at the bottom
20:10 layer of this or those are called the
20:12 raw materials um so the blank 0 0 1 is
20:16 what is used to make gear 2a
20:19 blank zero zero two is used to make here
20:21 two b
20:22 and now these two gears are together
20:24 making nearest and weight two so this
20:26 whole structure which is going it's a
20:28 hierarchical structure is called bill of
20:30 materials so when you this is very
20:32 simple for me because i'm only making
20:34 gear assembly but think about the car
20:37 manufacturer look at think about their
20:38 bill of material right if you if you
20:40 think of a finished
20:42 product which is a finished honda city
20:44 car for example the bill of material if
20:47 you keep breaking it down it will have
20:49 probably
20:50 50 to 60 levels right or a very large
20:54 number of levels because at the top
20:55 level you'll say car and then engine and
20:58 transmission and so on and then within
20:59 engine you could have multiple
21:02 sub assemblies and then within that
21:05 multiple uh
21:06 products and so on so so if you go all
21:09 the way across the value chain it will
21:10 have a large number of layers
21:14 so even if i'm using a simple screw
21:18 it would be there in the bill of
21:19 materials yes
21:21 absolutely yeah
21:24 okay so that's a lot of detail
