00:00 [Music]
00:15 so uh we saw
00:18 Trend uh Trend I think we should see the
00:24 most important thing GV is we saw market
00:26 share H I would be very curious to find
00:30 out how market shares changes over can
00:32 we see just just just one last thing
00:35 between male and female can we see I
00:36 mean I don't think there number of
00:40 transactions on credit card between male
00:41 and female and count of transactions
00:43 yeah between male and
00:47 female ah there is a men seem to be
00:51 using credit cards quite a bit more ah
00:53 Try by age also put AG in the column and
00:58 see not borrower age actually we should
00:60 should put categories age group
01:04 yeah how's it
01:07 saying the senior women seem to be more
01:11 okay with 23 or 91 so it's like 23 on
01:18 180 46 on
01:20 159 for young young females 46 on 159
01:26 okay which is like just take the
01:27 percentage 46 159 would how
01:29 much
01:52 30% roughly 29% no I think the formula
01:56 maybe some it's not correct it's not
01:59 correct okay let me do one 111 and 400
02:03 hold
02:05 B 5 divided
02:13 B7 yeah got it
02:17 okay somewhat so you can see that the
02:20 seniors senior women are even more
02:23 conservative than senior men youngsters
02:26 a little bit more but not that much
02:28 difference but the fact is that
02:31 men are twice as more likely to use
02:33 credit cards than women okay that's a
02:37 factor yeah um so if you wanted to sell
02:41 credit cards you should Target men
02:43 probably this count you should probably
02:44 Target men 3250 year old count this is
02:48 no can average of credit spending
02:59 also
03:00 roughly the same roughly the same here
03:02 there's no difference so this one
03:04 doesn't seem to have much difference
03:05 across all categories
03:08 correct okay all right we got sliced and
03:11 diced number of things we did sure um
03:15 yeah you were saying something about so
03:16 what I was saying is one thing that I'm
03:19 usually curious is we saw market share
03:22 right uh by
03:25 lender so we said
03:28 lender uh
03:30 age group we don't
03:38 need
03:40 right I'm now very curious to find out
03:43 how did this change over the
03:45 years market share Trend H right who's
03:49 winning with who's
03:52 losing in the market okay huh yeah
03:55 that's fine okay so you would put the
03:57 year on the I'll put the year in the
04:00 columns column okay you put in the row
04:04 okay I can flip
04:06 that ah you got three CS this graph this
04:09 is okay okay line chart is
04:13 good but this number now percentage you
04:16 want you want percentage
04:22 so I calculator you probably have to
04:25 calculate I think okay number also says
04:28 something number says something can
04:31 otherwise of course this guy is there
04:34 our favorite guy put it lat we'll see
04:37 what does it
04:40 say not that much AG so in
04:44 fy2 nbfc took slowly fbfc is growing
04:47 grow H fbfc is gradually creeping up and
04:53 PSU Banks seem to have lost market share
04:55 from 19 to 20 at least in this data
04:59 right
05:05 broadly broadly H yeah broadly yeah
05:10 Private Bank also is losing share
05:11 correct both are losing share to nbfc
05:13 that's what it's saying
05:17 H
05:18 okay nbfc is gaining share you can see
05:21 it from the numbers also if you look at
05:22 the numbers I think that go back to the
05:24 line chart I like that a little better
05:26 that add more
05:28 information
05:31 so the beauty is how easily you can
05:35 switch see this shows right you can see
05:39 that U private Banks actually are
05:41 growing also growing private banks are
05:43 growing nbfc is growing faster than
05:46 bankage just kind of
05:52 looking yeah isn't it
05:55 yeah
05:57 correct huh yep in credit cards in
06:01 credit cards
06:04 yeah
06:06 yep what else would you like to see I
06:09 want to see whether the same Trend year
06:10 wise you can do instead of PSU private
06:13 and credit remove that and place of that
06:15 put age
06:18 group we saw something some color like
06:21 that sure but this will give us I think
06:28 better this is what we saw no this what
06:31 we saw okay okay okay this is what we
06:33 saw this is what we saw so there's no
06:34 change that's the same thing all
06:37 right you can say take new to
06:43 credit oh we haven't analyzed new to
06:45 credit at all shall we look at new to
06:48 credit yeah so this is
06:51 Trends I if you want I can remove the
06:55 years what this is saying
06:58 is
07:00 if you look at the people who took loans
07:02 if 651 people took loans on credit
07:06 cards 200 of them had not taken any loan
07:09 before they're totally new this is the
07:11 first loan they they taking and they're
07:14 taking it on credit card because it is
07:16 very easy to access take on credit
07:18 card I think the first experience people
07:21 H we don't know some people may take
07:22 housing loan without having credit card
07:24 okay all right I understand first time
07:26 loan takers are taking it on credit card
07:28 25 of the four out of 651 446 people
07:32 already had some loan repeat loan don't
07:36 fire a new correct do the year now I
07:39 just want to see the trend is there a
07:45 trend which line are we looking at now
07:47 what is
07:50 what oh so what shows is in
07:56 fy21 people who had not taken loans
07:59 before became am conservative
08:01 M that's what it's showing they didn't
08:04 want to take loans on credit card on
08:06 credit card whereas guys who are
08:08 having during coid time lot of people
08:12 probably took credit card loans so those
08:14 who had loans those who had credit cards
08:18 who had experience using credit cards
08:20 actually they did more of it correct
08:22 they're divers the things are correct
08:25 this is cool this is nice H it's very
08:27 nice can we see a split of this is new
08:29 to credit by
08:31 age can why
08:35 not are the youngsters taking new credit
08:37 cards or who's taking
08:39 it not new credit cards but they're new
08:42 to credit taking new
08:51 credit doesn't really give us any new
08:55 information
08:56 [Music]
08:58 um
09:00 doesn't give
09:04 us 128 or 401 is 30%
09:09 2791 also 30% it's all the same yeah
09:13 it's not saying anything it's not saying
09:14 anything
09:16 no okay I think we have cut it anyway
09:20 huh new cred I think we've got some feel
09:22 for what to do credit card so how many
09:25 who's taking it who's cutting new credit
09:27 card or taking notes for the first time
09:28 on credit card correct what is the
09:31 average ticket size what is the split
09:32 male and female what is a split by year
09:35 how is the trend what is the trend year
09:36 wise how is it going yes which lender is
09:38 getting what share right okay we don't
09:43 know the purpose for which they're using
09:44 that information we don't have un for
09:46 credit card you know that is the ease of
09:50 use of credit card comes from the fact
09:51 that you don't have to tell why you
09:53 taking the loan right that's true H yeah
09:55 that's true when on the other hand when
09:57 you're taking a housing loan the process
09:60 is far more intricate yeah but of course
10:03 the interest rate is much
10:05 lower you know I mean I somehow get the
10:08 feeling that this credit card is an
10:09 urban
10:10 phenomenon possible okay where
10:13 unfortunately we don't have that see we
10:15 don't have Urban rural here we don't
10:16 have the urban rural thing whereas micro
10:18 Finance I think the rural finance I'm
10:20 not sure okay could be maybe this micro
10:23 Finance Urban but it looks more a rural
10:25 fom possibly so what might be
10:27 interesting is to see similar
10:30 not not everything maybe similar
10:31 statistics for micr finance if it's
10:33 there I don't know whether we have the
10:36 data Let's
10:40 see we do have some data unfilter it we
10:43 filtered everything else remove
10:45 everything all the filters and then do
10:47 it yeah we
10:51 have we do have data okay can we find
10:55 out the minimum and maximum loan size
10:57 let's start with
10:58 that
11:00 this is
11:02 average so there it was 2100 and 90k if
11:05 I remember an average 30k was the 30k
11:08 was average here it's 40K okay so
11:11 similar size what is the minimum minimum
11:14 is I
11:16 think five should give us the minimum
11:19 yeah 1,00,000 there was 2100 is th000
11:21 and
11:24 Max yeah small only you know W one and a
11:27 half lakhs I think people
11:30 business loans small business loans from
11:32 micro so, to one and a half lakhs then
11:34 average of a bigger range bigger range
11:37 than credit cards then credit cards yeah
11:39 looks like that no yeah and age group
11:42 can we do can we do a pivot now so what
11:44 did you want to do GV I want to do um
11:48 micr Finance Loans by uh age group age
11:51 profile which Okay Age profile is micr
11:55 finance lending going
11:56 to okay this is
11:60 actually let's just
12:05 restart
12:08 yeah yeah so what did you want to do
12:10 GV uh we were looking at micr Finance
12:13 because it has a rural color I guess so
12:17 can we do a micr finance profile by uh
12:21 age group age group so I've selected the
12:24 entire data let's insert a pivot
12:28 okay
12:30 H again sizes size every time I do a
12:34 pivot this is a
12:39 problem
12:40 okay so you want
12:44 uh segment of loan is micro Finance
12:48 yeah
12:50 yeah and uh age
12:55 uh
12:57 and count of uh
12:60 loans account of micr Finance
13:05 Loans so again
13:07 here again same thing similar to credit
13:09 card similar huh similar similar to
13:12 credit card most of the loans are going
13:13 to
13:17 M so I think it's a function of GV who
13:20 has the ability to repay and who has the
13:24 appetite to
13:26 borrow do by year do by year and see we
13:29 saw some seniors becoming more
13:31 conservative is it true for micr
13:34 also other way you have to do
13:38 switch yeah put a line
13:50 graph uh here why also started declining
13:54 everybody's declining actually here
13:56 unlike credit
13:58 card yeah huh yeah uh maybe in rural
14:03 area rural area people impacted by Co
14:07 correct possibly possibly yeah
14:10 hypothesis hypothesis yeah appears
14:14 whereas in urban there was not that much
14:15 Impact Credit Card spending continued
14:18 correct ni sir H something it tells you
14:24 something h h i
14:27 see it's also possible that micr Finance
14:30 Loans were more business
14:32 oriented ah business also suffered isn't
14:36 it maybe and credit card were more
14:39 consumption oriented right of course if
14:41 you do commercial loans you'll get a
14:42 know yeah the number is too small number
14:45 is too small yeah number is too small
14:47 and values are too large so we can try
14:49 don't vales you count only you can try
14:55 that numb are too small one two and all
14:58 you have with you don't want age group
14:59 you can age
15:02 group yeah this is
15:05 going so it's not commercial loans which
15:08 are urban urban actually Urban rural
15:10 only it is urban R commercial rural
15:12 loans are doing well corre credit card
15:14 is okay correct but micr Finance
15:17 struggling correct across categories
15:19 across categories young or medium or
15:22 senior
15:25 correct h
15:28 h some some sense you get some sense you
15:30 get yeah yeah you get some sense right
15:36 yeah Okay so we've got some
15:38 understanding I think JV of how people
15:41 borrow and how age
15:46 uh by age group by age group by we know
15:50 female Mal are borrowing more some some
15:53 sense we've got we got a sense uh now we
15:56 have to figure out how to apply this to
15:58 our original problem
15:59 remember we want to figure out how many
16:03 people will take a loan to buy a two
16:06 wheeler we have two wheer Loan Data
16:08 that's shall we take a look at that yeah
16:10 yeah two wheer Loan Data we should look
16:12 at so we will take type of
16:18 loan and we will filter
16:21 on let's compare it with auto loans just
16:24 just sure we'll first take a look at two
16:26 wheer loan then we'll they will have
16:28 similar character I think but we'll find
16:29 out there could be this kind of little
16:31 Urban D land
16:35 two so if you just look over the years I
16:38 think auto loans seem to have peaked in
16:41 fy19 little bit of a downward Trend I
16:44 mean two wheer loans seems to be a
16:47 downward Trend I think same thing rural
16:50 I think
16:51 rural try auto just just for the
16:54 it try auto and
16:57 see
16:59 ah also also Autos have been flat since
17:03 18 actually they not too many also small
17:06 number
17:09 only Auto industry seems to have a flat
17:12 three or four years yeah can we see
17:15 ticket size of Auto you can do you'll
17:18 get an idea of what kind of car they're
17:20 buying that's I'm trying to use it as a
17:22 proxy
17:23 again H so that is going
17:27 up right right yeah 10 lakhs has gone up
17:30 to 15 lakhs or 11 lakhs maybe has gone
17:33 up to 15 lakhs 1 lakh or 11 lakhs one
17:35 lakh it is 1 lakh oh 1 lakh has gone to
17:37 one and a half lakhs sorry and same if
17:41 you do the same thing for
17:42 two ticket
17:53 size it's going
17:56 up but that could just be inflation
17:59 actually some of this could just be
18:00 inflation could be no 25 to 30,000 it's
18:03 very looks like could just be inflation
18:06 you know the people are buying the same
18:07 kind of vehicle just that the vehicle
18:09 has become more expensive so possible
18:12 loan they need has become more more H
18:14 yeah just be
18:19 inflation okay okay so we want to see
18:22 what do we want to see two wheer loans
18:23 we want to see by lender type who's
18:24 Landing to two wheelers yes and then we
18:26 want to see the trend of that
18:29 market share of different players in two
18:31 wheer loans and how it's changing over
18:33 Years first we'll do the market share
18:35 without the
18:37 year P chart what is required
18:42 here this thing is we don't want so many
18:46 zeros and we don't want average no we
18:49 want here we want
18:52 Count oh wow look at that put in pie
18:57 chart
19:05 man is dominated completely by
19:08 nbfc we saw that already yesterday we
19:11 saw that yesterday nbfc is dominating it
19:14 and BSU bank has got not much of a
19:17 player
19:18 yes
19:20 uh okay H Trend can we see
19:25 wise put the year in Ro
19:27 yeah
19:29 and now let's put it in
19:32 stacked percentage bar
19:35 chart we hang of this
19:47 now see
19:50 Rec has tried to come out in 20 tried to
19:53 make a attack on
19:55 it but then Co made
19:59 dominant player private bank is holding
20:02 its
20:04 own okay not much of a change in Trend
20:07 no they're holding the share
20:12 yeah if
20:14 we wanted to look
20:17 at uh age group Next no no total loan
20:21 value ah H that may be more better to
20:26 view as this one
20:33 H so the total Market went up from let
20:37 us say 15 lakhs to almost 35 lakhs in
20:40 two
20:42 years mostly grow by nbfc look at the
20:45 NFC thing correct how it's gone but then
20:48 it has dropped from 35
20:51 lakh to almost maybe 27 28 lakhs the
20:56 number of transactions don't seem to
20:57 indicate it but yeah isn't it it did
20:59 decline we did decline deine it is this
21:01 is declining
21:03 faster value is declining like anything
21:05 yeah if you want to see the same thing
21:07 for auto since you were can check what
21:11 happened number is too small
21:14 yeah there also is declining yeah but
21:17 actually if you look at 20 to 21 it has
21:20 grown a little
21:22 bit and here if you see PSU banks are
21:25 much better placed better than two
21:26 wheelers correct correct isn't it not
21:28 having a play two whe at
21:30 all they're only lending in correct
21:33 correct correct huh you're right isn't
21:34 it
21:36 yes they're not lending two wheer
21:38 they're lending
21:43 cars
21:44 okay let's go back to two wheelers yeah
21:47 two wheelers by age group age group you
21:51 want uh age group H Group H
21:54 group drop the lender type let Lo group
21:59 keep the
22:04 year and draw a line
22:12 graph won
22:23 count now what is it
22:25 saying seniors are ever
22:30 have
22:31 theys nothing has changed nothing has
22:33 changed but both youngsters
22:36 and middleaged people have become
22:39 conservative after
22:42 F9 saying H yeah youngsters have become
22:46 even more conservative even more
22:47 conservative maybe they were not very
22:49 sure of their job situation Co or
22:51 whatever right yeah middle age people
22:54 were a little bit more settled in fact
22:56 after they quickly recovered because you
22:57 see after 2021 it's kind of more I think
22:60 actually after Co lot of people want did
23:03 not want to travel in bus
23:06 uh ah so maybe that is what has
23:10 triggered this saved saved the
23:14 middle-aged people correct correct
23:16 possible isn't it yep correct many
23:19 people said if we don't have in that
23:21 consumption but if train information
23:23 consumtion correct have shown in the yes
23:26 reduction in transport cost correct no
23:29 isn't it we saw the transport costs were
23:31 there correct have seen a reduction in
23:32 public transport cost or in the
23:34 aspirational pyramid also you could have
23:35 seen perhaps that you know intention to
23:37 buy would have been jumping
23:40 jumping
23:42 maybe if I look at Auto here instead of
23:46 two
23:47 wheeler what is this so
23:51 this now your your hypothesis but
23:55 middle-age people said I will stick to
23:58 us smaller
23:59 ticket seniors are saying I want to go
24:01 by car because it's safer correct maybe
24:04 but middle age people are saying I want
24:07 to be safe so I'll buy a vehicle of my
24:09 own youngsters also saying way they also
24:10 going be car maybe they switch from two
24:12 wheer to car maybe people switch from to
24:15 car because of maybe safety reasons but
24:17 why are the M's dropping the M have
24:19 dropped m is dropped dramatically
24:22 dramatically H sharp
24:24 decline don't know very it's number is
24:28 small also so we don't know could be
24:29 anomaly yeah it went up from 1920 that
24:33 is the interesting thing where everybody
24:36 else is going
24:38 down and then it sh
24:43 fall
24:44 yeah isn't it
24:47 yep something some data
24:52 okay okay what else would you like I
24:54 mean I think the interesting thing at
24:56 least for me here mil is that with just
24:58 some tweaks some drop downs you're just
24:60 tweaking with the numbers pulling down
25:01 drop down pulling like a magician
25:04 playing with a thing it's giving you
25:07 coming you're just producing graphs yes
25:10 one after the other after the other
25:11 right yes quickly you can generate
25:12 graphs in 10 minutes you can produce
25:14 five graphs yes huh yes that's the value
25:16 of this that is the value absolutely
25:18 it's not just graphs right it's also
25:21 there's information information you're
25:23 trying to digest the you know
25:24 information that's coming in the form of
25:25 visual right yeah
25:28 so you can do phenomenal analysis in and
25:30 I think that is really to my mind GV the
25:33 purpose of this course right the purpose
25:35 of this course is to encourage the
25:37 students to take large sets of data not
25:41 be large some sets of data sets of data
25:43 meaningful sets of data and try and
25:45 slice and dice it in Excel simple
25:49 different ways ex and usually use just
25:51 using Excel or Google Sheets Google
25:53 Sheets basically use the spreadsheet
25:55 model spreadsheet model and plot the
25:57 graphs and try to make sense yes right
26:00 and you can learn a lot like that you
26:01 can learn a lot enough like that I think
26:04 that's what it is
26:07 yeah
26:12 okay
