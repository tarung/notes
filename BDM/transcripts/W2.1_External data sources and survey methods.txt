00:00 Start of segment.  
00:17 In this segment, we are going to be discussing   external data sources. Where do you get 
data from, external data from that you can  
00:29 use to analyze the various things that 
we discuss in the economic models. So,  
00:40 quick relook at what we discussed in the economic 
model thing, we said basically that there are  
00:47 firms and there are households. We divide actually 
all the entities, business, the activities that  
00:55 are going on, economic activities that are going 
on into firms on one side and households on the   other side. So, households are consumers, they 
consume and the firms basically either produce  
01:08 or they trade or they store or they transport 
or they manage finance or something like that.
01:13 So, all those activities are going on 
inside firms, whereas the consumption   activities are happening inside the households 
and the interaction between the firms and the  
01:23 households are taking place in one direction, 
which means when the firms sell products and   services to households, that interaction is taking 
place through the product markets and the other  
01:31 side where the households are providing labour, 
capital or land to the firms that direction is  
01:38 happening through the resource markets. So, that 
is what we said is the basic economic model. Now,  
01:46 where exactly does data come into 
this? Where do you get data from? So,  
01:53 first place to look for, we said also that the 
government has a role to play in all this because  
01:60 they collect taxes and provide some public 
goods and incentives or transfers and so on.   But the government also has a much bigger role 
to play, which is in terms of gathering data.
02:10 So, government provides information. This is 
a very, very important role of the government.   So, let us look at some basic sources of data 
that come from the government. The first,  
02:22 there are some sources of data that the government 
provides, which are infrequent, which comes once  
02:32 like in the case of census, it comes once in 
10 years. But so the last census was in 2011.
02:42 In fact, the 2021 census could not be 
held because of COVID. But we have been  
02:48 having one census every 10 years, ever 
since 1950s. And the census basically is  
02:58 comprehensive. Comprehensive means every 
single household in India is covered. So,  
03:04 they go knocking on everybody's 
house and collect data. So, this is not sampling. This is  
03:11 complete data capture of every single household 
in the country. So, that is called economic,  
03:19 that is called census. Similarly, there is a 
census on this side. This is for households. So, census is done by households. Similarly, 
there is an economic census of firms, small firms,  
03:28 big firms, all kinds of firms. And this 
economic census again is comprehensive,  
03:33 which means every single firm is 
covered. So, whereas the census is,  
03:39 census by definition means 
that you cover everybody.   Therefore, it requires a lot of resources 
and amount of time and money and all that.
03:47 So, it is done very infrequently. So, census is 
done by 10 years. But there are more frequent   things done. For example, there is a national 
sample survey that is done more frequently.  
03:58 And there is a national, 
there is a household consumer. So, national sample survey, we have had 72 
of them in the countries in Singapore. And  
04:07 there is a household consumer expenditure survey 
that is done on the household side. Similarly,   there is an annual survey of industries, 
annual means every year. There is a survey  
04:16 of industries done every year, which covers 
firms. So, this is a high frequency because   it is more, when we say high frequency, 
it basically means relative to census.
04:26 Census once is 10 years, whereas the 
annual survey of industry is annual. Here,  
04:32 this is 10 years, this might be more often. 
So, you are doing it more often. Of course,   we will discuss that there are private sources of 
information that are even more faster than this,  
04:42 that means more frequency than this. So, 
even try three times a year and so on. But the government source of information, 
it is very difficult to get the government  
04:50 to do things in a time frame where you get 
things in 3 months, 6 months and so on. So,   you usually get information once in a few 
years, but not once in 10 years like in  
04:59 census. But these things are sample based. So, 
the definition national sample survey, when you  
05:04 say national sample survey, it means sample. So, 
there is a methodology to doing the sampling. It picks certain households, we will 
discuss how they do it. And they cover  
05:13 those households in great detail. But only a 
few households are covered, not all of them,  
05:19 sample of households. And based 
on that, you can form, you know,  
05:24 statistics allows you by to form a picture of 
the whole by doing sampling of the part. So,   you sample some and then use that to construct the 
picture of the whole and it will have some error,  
05:33 but the error will be small, basically, 
if you do the sampling correctly. So, government sources of information are 
very, very important for us. Just as an example  
05:51 of a government source of data, there is this 
thing called economic census. So, I am just  
05:56 showing you basically how the, what is called the 
schedule. Schedule means basically the form, how  
06:01 it is, how it looks. So, this is the form that is 
carried by the, by the field officer to fill data.
06:11 So, one row in this basically is one house. 
So, you can see basically that it is got   the census number for the house. So, census 
basically, remember census covers everybody. So,  
06:23 that census number is there, house 
or you know, structure basically,   it could be firm means that there will be a firm, 
for the firm also there will be a structure. And  
06:34 then the name of the establishment owner, 
the name of the owner of the establishment,  
06:39 how many members are there, what does that 
description, what does that establishment do.
06:44 The reason why we are calling sometimes 
it is using household and all that because   many of the establishments that we have 
are actually home establishments because  
06:52 they are businesses run from homes. So, you 
cannot separate really the business from the   household that is the issue actually. What is 
the broad activity? So, there is a two digit code  
07:04 for the broad activity. So, there is indicator 
here. For example, if it is livestock it is 0,2,   if it is transportation and storage it is 
1,3, if it is education it is 20 like that.
07:14 So, there is a two digit code that you will enter 
here. There is a NIC, NIC stands for National  
07:19 Industrial Classification Code. So, there is a 
code for that NIC, NIC code that comes. Then,  
07:25 you know, is it a handloom type activity, 
handicraft activity? What is the ownership   structure? Is it a government, private, 
partnership? Is it a self-help group? Is  
07:35 it a cooperative like that? Is it a male run or 
a female run? What social group, what religion?  
07:41 What is the nature of operation and all that? And 
how many people are employed? How many males are   employed? How many females are employed? Like 
that. How many on hired basis, which means on  
07:52 contract basis? How many on, how many are not 
hired, which means that basically are temporary.
07:57 Like that you write down all the things. 
That is one row basically gives you one   establishment, like that there are many rows. So,  
08:04 this is the schedule. This is how they collect 
information. And based on that information,   some analysis can be given like the last 
latest economic census report that we had.
08:17 I have put some charts from it to 
show you. So, this chart on the   left shows what is the percentage of rural 
establishments, how are they financed? So,  
08:26 for example, in rural establishments, 
72.7 percent of the rural establishments  
08:32 are self-financed. 10 percent are, have 
assistance from the government sources.
08:38 2.4 percent percent have borrowing 
from financial institutions,   that is how they are financed. Some of 
them are borrowed from moneylenders,  
08:46 that is how they are financed. Some have got 
loan from self-help group, that is how. Some   of them have got it from donation and all that. 
So, majority of the rural firms are self-financed.
08:55 In fact, if you look at urban, it is even more. 
83.7 percent of the urban establishments are  
09:01 self-financed. So, you can see how big, how 
big the potential for organized finances,  
09:10 for organized lending or organized 
financing of firms, how big it is,   because most of the firms today are 
all financed by self-finance. So,  
09:18 that is a scope for people to take money 
from elsewhere and expand their business.
09:24 This chart on the right side shows how many 
establishments are there with 10 or more  
09:31 workers. So, which states what percentage of the 
establishment with 10 or more workers, how are  
09:38 they distributed? So, you can see that a very 
large number of establishments with 10 or more   workers are in Tamil Nadu. 14 percent are in Tamil 
Nadu, 11 percent in West Bengal, Maharashtra. So,  
09:47 these are all, these states here, Tamil Nadu, 
West Bengal, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Kerala,  
09:53 account for 14, 11, 25, 35, 7, 42, 48. Half, 
half the establishments are in these states.
10:03 And some states have hardly any rights, you can 
see that. So, that is what this picture says. So,  
10:09 these very interesting views you get like 
this, which you can present also in a form   of pie chart or some bar chart or something, but 
you get very interesting views of what is going  
10:20 on in terms of how establishments are formed 
and so on using this economic census report.  
10:29 Similarly, if you take the annual survey 
of industries, I am not showing you the   schedule because it is very, very elaborate, 
they, what they collect a lot of information.  
10:38 So, you can see some of the charts that have 
come from the latest annual survey of industries,   2022 this is, it shows basically percentage 
share of major industries and total number of  
10:51 persons engaged in factory sector, which means 
how many people are working in factory sector.
10:57 You take that set of people and you say how much 
of that, what percentage of that are working in  
11:03 food products. So, you find 11 percent of 
the total number of people in factories,   factory sector are employed in food 
products, 10 percent in textiles, 8,  
11:11 7 and a half percent in apparel, 7.25 percent 
in metal, 6.5 percent in motor vehicle, 6.
11:19 3 percent like this. So, you can see the breakup. 
So, some sectors are highly employment intensive,  
11:24 some of them are not so employment intensive, 
that is what this seems to show. Similarly, you   can say where are the people, which states are the 
people who are working in factories, which states  
11:34 are they in and you find that Tamil Nadu is one of 
the states which has a large number of people. So,   you can see that we have two and a half lakh 
people working in factories in Tamil Nadu,  
11:43 whereas Gujarat is the next and then Maharashtra 
and then there are other states like that.   So, all this information has come out 
of from the annual survey of industries.
11:53 Here is another one, which says what is the 
aggregate GVA, GVA stands for gross value added.  
12:00 So, a company might be getting all the components 
of mobile phones and then assembling the mobile  
12:06 phone in India and selling it. So, we asked 
what is the gross value added of that assembly  
12:12 process. So, it might be only 4 percent because 
when it sold 100 rupees worth of mobile phone,   96 rupees it may have gotten components, PCB, 
class take, everything it may have imported  
12:22 and added 4 rupees worth of value and sold. So, in 
that case, the gross value added is only 4 rupees,  
12:28 even though it sold 100 rupees of phone, 
only 4 rupees is the gross value added. So, we calculate exactly the value addition due 
to a process. So, if you look at it like that,  
12:38 you find that chemical and chemical products is 
adding 11.17 percent of the total value is coming   from there, 10 percent from metals, pharma is 8 
percent, food products 8 percent, motor vehicle  
12:48 7 like that, you can write down the gross 
value added. This is another very interesting   outcome of the annual survey of industries. 
Now, the NSS, the National Sample Survey,  
13:01 what it does basically is it divides, so based on 
census again, it you can divide the country into  
13:08 various census blocks, you know, regions and in 
each of those regions, basically you create, you  
13:17 do, you pick a sample, you pick some and when I 
come to this, when I, later on when I discuss one  
13:24 of the surveys in little bit more detail, I will 
explain how the samples chosen very carefully. But, you know, you pick from each 
of these regions, you pick a sample,  
13:31 you pick some people and then you 
do some estimations. In this case,  
13:39 the NSS 72nd round, the National Sample 
Survey 72nd focused on two areas,  
13:44 one is how much do households spend on services, 
services means like transportation, education,  
13:51 healthcare and all that, business services and so 
on. And how much do they spend on durable goods,  
13:56 durable goods means refrigerator, air conditioner, 
things like that. So, this charts are basically  
14:04 about transportation. So, we are seeing basically 
that we have looked at the rural and urban. So, this chart is rural, this chart is urban. 
Data is presented in this form. So, you have  
14:15 divided the population into five what are called 
quintiles, which means you are saying the top  
14:21 and based on their quintile class based on 
their usual monthly per capita expenditure.  
14:28 So, somebody who is spending, so you divide, you 
basically calculate the total expenditure of the  
14:34 household and you sort all of them and the people 
who fall in the top 20 percent of expenditures,  
14:41 they are in the top quintile. People who 
in the bottom 20 percent expenditures,   they are in the bottom 20 percent quintile 
and the others in the middle somewhere. So,  
14:50 the top quintile, I mean top 20 percent of the 
total spenders, expenditures, with the top 20  
14:57 percent of the highest expenditures 
in some sense, monthly expenditures. If you look at their expenditures, you will 
find basically that their biggest source of  
15:07 expenditure seems to be on bus. So, they are 
spending about 180 rupees on bus monthly,  
15:13 180 rupees on bus and this blue line first one 
is railway, they are spending about 40 because  
15:18 maybe from Bombay or something they travel 
by train or metro or something like that. So,   50 rupees they are spending on railway, 180 
rupees on bus and taxi some amount and then  
15:30 you know the auto rickshaw and others. 
Whereas, if you take the bottom quintile,   they are hardly spending any money. So, you 
can see basically that even these people,  
15:37 the bus is the biggest form of 
transport, it is about 30 rupees but.
15:42 If you go to rural areas, even 
the top quintile, if you look,   they are also spending the most amount on 
railway, on bus, their bus spending basically  
15:51 is 80 rupees compared to 180 rupees. Here it 
is 180, here it is 80. So, the top quintile  
15:57 in the rural area spending 80 rupees on bus, 
whereas the urban area they are spending 180.   Here there is not that much scope to spend on 
railway I think because railway train may not  
16:07 be going to all the rural areas and all. So, 
they are not spending much but this person is   spending because of metro train and because 
of local suburban railway and other things.
16:15 So, you can see these kind of very 
interesting consumption patterns   that come out by analysis of the data that 
comes out from the National Sample Survey.  
16:28 Besides those data sources, which data 
sources, what I explained, the census,  
16:35 the National Sample Survey, the census, economic 
census, annual survey of industries besides these,  
16:40 there are many other government sources of 
data also that are available. For example,   you will have tax data. You get very fine 
grained data of GST by different types of  
16:49 products and services, which give you 
an indication of which products are   being sold in which region in the country. The 
Reserve Bank of India and the Stock Exchange,  
16:57 they give you a lot of information on capital 
raising and lending and everything else.
17:03 There is a thing called the periodic labour 
force survey, PLFS, which tells you what  
17:10 is the employment that is happening, 
how many people are getting employed,   how many people are out of labour market, how many 
people, what wages are they getting employed at,  
17:17 where are they getting employed, that kind of 
thing you get from PLFS. So, you will get a   view of the labour market. How many licenses are 
given, how many road transport licenses are given,  
17:28 how many driving licenses were issued, all 
these kind of information you will get.  
17:34 You will get wholesale price index and consumer 
price index. So, the total, how is inflation,  
17:40 how is the price of general products and 
services, how is it moving? Right now,   it looks like tomato and many other 
things, the prices seem to be going up.
17:47 So, that will impact the consumer price index.   And of course, people can always, through 
this thing called right to information,  
17:55 you can always ask for more information from 
the government. Nowadays, the government   publishes everything. In fact, I want to 
show you this site, which is called data.
18:05 gao.in. I am not sure whether you can read 
what I have typed in the URL, but it is,  
18:11 I have typed data.gao.in. So, the idea 
basically is that the government is saying   that they want to make as far as possible 
all the information available publicly,  
18:24 either for you to look at or for you to even 
access through APIs and do your own analytics.
18:30 You can generate your own charts. So, they 
are saying basically that now they have so  
18:37 many resources, 623,000, 623,000 resources. How 
many times it has been downloaded, 9.79 million  
18:44 downloads they have got. So, you can see basically 
that you can discover it by sector, by groups,  
18:52 whether it is central government or 
state government, you can write your   own APIs and access it and 
all the data sets are there.  
19:04 So, health and family welfare, agriculture, census 
and surveys, water and sanitation, statistics,  
19:10 education, water resources, transport, 
finance, government, plenty of data.
19:15 All the data, of course, you will have to 
log in, you have to create a registration,   log in and say why you need this data. So, 
there is log in register, but by and large,  
19:23 you can easily register and you can get hold of 
your, you can get hold of your data. For example,  
19:30 this UDICE is basically an education database 
that is there here, present statistics, budget  
19:39 for sports, how much was given like that. So, 
they have tried to make available every possible  
19:46 data that is there in different ministries, they 
are trying to make available in a central place. So, it becomes a lot easier for you 
to access it. So, you do not really,  
19:54 I mean, right to information is there, but 
nowadays it is not really required to do  
19:60 right to information because even without right 
to information, you can actually, government is  
20:05 making everything available. So, you can just go 
and get it. So, besides the government sources,  
20:14 before I go on to non-government 
sources, I want to talk about this  
20:20 thing which we talked about here, which is 
a periodic labour force survey, PLFS. So,  
20:26 here is an example of a chart which comes from 
the latest 21-22 periodic labour force survey.
20:33 This relates to something that I had said earlier 
also. You just look at in rural and urban, how are  
20:43 they, how are the people employed? So, you find 
basically that 54 percent of the people in rural  
20:49 areas are self-employed, they are not working 
for any company. Only 13.8 percent are getting  
20:57 regular wages or salaries in India, 25.2 percent 
are casual level, it means they get paid daily,  
21:03 daily wages. And in the urban area, 33, this is 
54 percent, in the urban area it has reduced,  
21:09 but still it is very large, 33 percent are 
self-employed, self-employed means like hawkers,  
21:16 dobies or something like that, people who are 
basically doing their own business self-employed. And in the urban area, 43 percent are wage 
earning, regular wage earning. In the rural area,  
21:27 it is only 13.8. Of course, one should expect 
that if you are having a farm, you are more   likely to be self-employed, but still this number 
is very, very small. And even in the urban area,  
21:36 43 percent being organized and the remaining 
being self-employed, unorganized is not very good.
21:42 I mean, you need to have more people 
organized. 11 percent are casual labor   and 12 percent means basically daily 
wage labor and 12 percent are others,  
21:52 sometimes in work, sometimes 
not in work type of thing.   So, let me move on now to the non-government 
data sources. Now, there are many places from  
22:05 where you can get non-government data sources. 
One of them is, for example, there is a, there  
22:11 is an index called purchasing manager's index, 
which basically gives you sentiment analysis.  
22:17 What are firms doing in terms of buying? Are they 
going to buy or not buy? That kind of decision.
22:23 It is called purchasing manager's index. 
And if it shows some number above 50,   it means that firms are optimistic about 
the future. If it shows a number below 50,  
22:30 it means firms are pessimistic about 
the future. But we are not discussing   that right now. The main focus for us will 
be data that comes from this organization,  
22:38 which is called the Center for Monitoring Indian 
Economy. This is a big provider of data for a  
22:45 lot of companies, which basically then use 
it to make decisions, strategic decisions. That is why we are interested in CMI 
data. So, we will primarily focus,  
22:53 so CMI produces two kinds of data, as we 
saw in economic, what we said earlier,  
22:58 you either look at this side or you look 
at this side. So, if you decide basically   is households and their consumption, this 
side is about firms and their investments.  
23:07 So, the CAPEX report of CMIE tells you where, 
which sectors firms are investing in, whereas the  
23:15 consumer pyramids household survey of CMIE tells 
you what households are buying or intend to buy.  
23:25 So, we will be mostly focused on this. In fact, 
I will show you what they do, how they do the   survey and in the next segment, we will actually 
take the data that has come from the survey and  
23:35 go through it in great amount of detail, so 
that you get a feel for what is going on.
23:41 So, the consumer pyramids household survey 
of CMIE, the last, I mean, this picture,  
23:47 snapshot was taken August very recently, in some 
sense from the date of recording right now. So,  
23:54 basically, we are saying now that 
236,000 households. So, right now,  
24:01 the wave that is in progress is 29th wave, 
which will go from May to August of 2023.
24:07 The response rate at this point in time is 62.99%. 
So, what they basically have found is that on the  
24:14 average, they get about 73% responses, which 
means that if they go to a house and try to get  
24:19 a response, many of them may not be there, house 
will be locked, there will be reasons, but they   have been able to get 63% of the houses, they have 
been able to get some response, which is very good  
24:28 actually, this kind of response rate is extremely 
good. So, 236,000 households were surveyed.  
24:35 It is a longitudinal survey. Now, there is a very 
interesting, this longitudinal survey is a very  
24:41 interesting kind of survey, it means that the 
same households you will go to again and again.  
24:47 This is very important, because if you go 
and do a sample of 10 people in this round,  
24:53 and in the next round, you do 
another sample of 10 people,   and there is no relation between this 10 people 
that you sampled this time and the 10 people you  
24:60 sample next time, then you do not know how 
consumption pattern has changed over time. Of course, you will get some broad aggregate 
picture. But if you go to the same household  
25:08 two times, I went, last year, I went again 
this year, and I found in the same house,  
25:13 last year, they were consuming, you know, so 
many litres of milk in a month, this year,  
25:19 they are consuming a little bit more milk 
every month, then it gives you a more definite   confirmation that this house basically is moving 
up the economic ladder or something like that. In  
25:29 the sense that they are consuming more products, 
which are, you know, as, as income goes up,   you will start consuming certain kinds of 
products like milk and so on, protein products  
25:37 will get consumed more, meat and all that will 
get consumed more. So, you can confirm that. So,  
25:43 it is firstly longitudinal, which means the same 
houses are visited again and again. Secondly,   it is a fast frequency survey, which means that 
you are surveying, remember, I told you sensors  
25:52 is done once every 10 years, these other 
things are done a little bit more often. But here you are doing three times every year. 
So, you are doing three surveys every year. So,  
26:02 that is why it is called a fast frequency 
survey. Now, what are the different kinds   of things on which data is collected? One 
is called the people of India database,  
26:10 which basically tells you the attributes 
and peculiarities of Indian people,   not that interesting for us. The second thing 
which is of greatest interest for us is the  
26:19 consumption pyramid, which means what did they 
consume in the last one month, this is called   the consumption pyramid. The third is aspirational 
data, what do they want to consume? They are not  
26:29 consumed the last month, but they are looking 
forward to buying something like for example,   they want to buy a refrigerator, they 
want to buy a car or something like that.
26:36 Normally, you do not keep buying cars, you buy a 
car, then you may not buy car for other 15 years.   So, I had asking them question about whether 
you own a car that is coming here, but do you,  
26:46 what do you do you intend to buy a car in the 
next six, three months or something like that,  
26:52 that question is asked here. And then income, 
what kind of income do they have? How is the  
26:57 income changing? What is the volatility of 
income and all that is the income pyramid. So,   in the subsequent segments, we are 
going to focus quite a lot on these two,  
27:06 these two data sets, consumption pyramid 
data set and aspirational India data set,  
27:12 because one of them tells you how 
they are spending their money. And this one tells you how they, what are 
the things they would like to buy. So,  
27:19 that tells you that. So, what exactly do 
they do? How do they do their survey? So,  
27:25 first thing they do basically is they identify 
what are called primary sampling units,   which are based on the census. How the census 
is done? Remember census covers everybody. So,  
27:34 based on that, they can choose the 
primary sampling units and they group.
27:42 So, then from this, they create something called 
a homogeneous region. A homogeneous region is a  
27:48 set of neighboring districts within a state that 
has similar conditions. So, relatively similar  
27:54 urbanization levels, similar female literacy, 
similar size in terms of households as per 2011  
27:60 census. The idea being that if you take two 
regions, which are very different from each  
28:06 other in terms of either size of households or 
in terms of literacy rate or something, and you   try to randomly sample, you may get a biased 
sample. But if you take a homogeneous region,  
28:17 it means a region where all the districts in 
that region basically are roughly alike. So,  
28:22 it does not matter whether I choose from here or 
choose from there, I will get the same result. So, take a homogeneous region and from that region 
you choose a sample and make sure that all the  
28:32 homogeneous regions, different homogeneous regions 
are all represented. So, that is basically how the   sampling is done. So, bias is removed because 
of this concept called homogeneous region. So,  
28:42 you can see how the homogeneous regions, how the 
households are split across various things. So,  
28:48 rural homogeneous regions on the average 
634, the very large towns like this,  
28:54 large towns like this, medium towns and small 
towns, how does it split up? What is the min,   max, average number of households pick? So, 
they have basically ensured that you are picking  
29:04 households from across the spectrum, all this 
data, you are not picking it only from rural,   only from small towns or something 
like that, everything is covered.
29:15 State wise also there is some distribution. 
So, you can see basically that how many towns   are covered in Andhra Pradesh, 14 towns were 
covered and how many households were covered,  
29:23 5000 households are covered, how many samples 
were taken and all that. So, you can see that. So,  
29:29 it is basically covering everything. So, with 
that we come to the end of this segment. So,  
29:37 what we are learning from this segment 
basically is that we can use surveys  
29:44 of various kinds, some of them are government has 
done the surveys and calculated, otherwise this   private agencies like CMI has done surveys and 
these surveys basically generate data and this  
29:57 data is of use to us to do some charting like we 
saw to get some insights into what is going on.
30:03 So, in the next segment, we will go deep dive 
into some of the survey data and try to get some  
30:09 really, really deep insights. Hopefully, 
you will find it interesting. Thank you.
