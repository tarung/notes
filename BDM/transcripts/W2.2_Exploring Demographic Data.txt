00:15 Millin, let us first shall we take a look
at the datasets that we have. Sure.
00:20 We seem to have two datasets both coming from
CMI, I think. And one of them is, what is it?
00:30 It is a consumption data? It is, I think one is the consumption data
and the second is.
00:36 So, consumption data would say what? I mean, it would tell you, it is by households
presumably.
00:42 It is by households, yes. So, you will go to, so they have gone to some
sample households and then in each household they have asked some questions.
00:48 Correct. And these questions will basically tell you
what is it that they consumed weekly or monthly
00:55 or something, monthly presumably. I think weekly is also there.
01:00 Let us just see. We can search, maybe we can search for weekly.
01:06 Maybe it is monthly, does not matter actually. So, if it is, so you know by month what they
have consumed and in that month they, what
01:20 kind of? It is monthly. Monthly. And what kind of, I mean did they consume
food, if they consume food, what kind of food?
01:27 Did they travel? Should we see what is there? Why do not we do that? Why do not we do that?
01:33 So, what would be, this is a, this is Excel
sheet we got. This is the Excel sheet that we have got from
CMIE.
01:39 Now, the problem GV is that it is a very,
very big sheet. This is a sample sheet, so it has only 100
rows.
01:45 If you go down, I think it has about 100 rows. So, it is a, I mean it is a sample.
01:50 It is a sample, it is not a full set. It is not a full set which you need. It has a 100.
01:56 They just gave us something. Yeah, correct. But if you look at the columns.
02:01 So, what is the first one? Household ID, they have given an ID for each
house. So that, when they go next time to the CMOS,
presumably they carry same ID maybe.
02:10 And state, obvious. State, obvious. So, what kind of states are represented here? Is there a way to, I mean, how do I get all
that?
02:19 Can I get a unique list of all the states
or something? This if we click on filter, we will get all
the, all the, all the.
02:31 What are the states that we have? They have Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Chhattisgarh. You have filtered the entire set? Yeah.
02:37 So, here is what I did. I took the entire selection and applied a
filter. I applied a filter.
02:43 So, actually the filter was already active. So, I will show you how we, I applied the
filter.
02:49 That means that every column will now get. Every column now has a filter. Drop down. Yes, every column will get a drop down.
02:55 Drop down. Yes. And that drop down will contain all the elements,
one unique, only unique element. All the unique elements that are present in
that column.
03:03 So here what do we see? We see Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Chhattisgarh,
Delhi, Goa, Gujarat, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh,
03:14 Jammu and Kashmir, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Kerala,
Madhya Pradesh. So they have all the states.
03:20 It is almost like very comprehensive, Madhya
Pradesh, Maharashtra, Odisha, Puducherry,
03:26 Punjab, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Telangana,
Tripura, Uttar Pradesh. I think it is.
03:31 But you have only 100. So, which means that 20 odd states, 100, 4
or 5. 100.
03:36 So, maybe there are like, we can check actually. Let us see how many samples are there from
Maharashtra. How do you find out?
03:41 We can just select Maharashtra. Just select Maharashtra in this.
03:48 Maharashtra. And we have, we can count now if I just select
all of these and we go to the bottom, there
03:58 are about 11 samples from Maharashtra. You can see this here. There are a lot of samples.
04:03 What about Tirupurar? Yeah, let us take one of the smallest states
now maybe. Take Tripura or something.
04:09 Tirupurar, let us take. Let us see, maybe there is only one.
04:15 This has got 11? Just one. Too much. Too much. Just another bit.
04:20 Yes. We can try Goa. Goa is the only one. Probably 2. 2.
04:26 Let us look at Uttar Pradesh. Uttar Pradesh will be a big one. Should have been.
04:32 Must be more. Yeah, big one. It is a big state. Let us take Uttar Pradesh. Yeah, so it is probably like 14.
04:39 So, they have tried to take samples based
on the population per se. Probably. Wow.
04:45 Probably. That is nice. So, West Bengal also should be there. Yeah, that is nice. Yeah. So, we will do that.
04:51 So, what is the population? So, what is the population? So, West Bengal also should be big. I think West Bengal has a lot of. West Bengal has a good population. Maharashtra has a good population.
04:57 Correct. Maharashtra we saw 11. Uttar Pradesh is 14. Let us see West Bengal. So, let me remove Uttar Pradesh and select
West Bengal.
05:03 Only 4. And maybe if we look at the actual, the entire
sample, maybe we will get a more representative.
05:09 So, this is not necessarily giving you the
same percentage as population. Correct.
05:15 Take Karnataka, Karnataka I think has 6 crores
out of, out of 40.
05:21 140 crores. 140. So, it is like 6, 6 and 100.
05:26 6 and 100. Not bad. Here and there, here and there. So, I understand. So, we got all the states, then what do we
have?
05:34 So, this is something called a homogenous
region. Do you know what a homogenous region is?
05:41 It is, I think, region, it is, I mean. At least what I could figure out from their
website is it seems to say that it is a subunit
05:51 of a state where people seem to have similar. Buying performance. Buying performance. So, as an example, they would say Bangalore
is perhaps a different homogenous region compared
06:03 to. Humbly. Humbly or Tumkur or something like that. Or a rural area, something like that.
06:10 And then it says urban versus rural. That is very important. That is, that is straightforward. That is very straightforward thing. And then month, month and year, month and
year.
06:19 This is month slot. Which year, which month they went and did
the survey?
06:25 Correct. Month and year. Correct. What is this? This is the month for which they gathered
the data.
06:31 So, they went in April, but they asked the
household.
06:38 About December 19th. About December 19th. Oh my. So, the data could be. So, the data could be. So, the resensory effects will be.
06:44 Correct. So, if you take January 20, you will get reasonably
good reliable. Better. Yes, yes, yes. But if you go April, you are not going to
get that.
06:51 So, if you see, all the data in this column
is for December 19th. Yes.
06:57 However, the data has been collected in different
months. It has been collected, some data has been
collected in January, some in February, some
07:07 in March, some in April. Because they could not do it all at one time. Correct. I see.
07:13 Very interesting. So, of course, some of this could also have
been impacted by COVID lockdown. This is 2020, but 20, 20 is started.
07:20 20 is when it started, no? Did not it? I think April 20 was when the first lockdown.
07:27 Just came maybe. Just before, prior to, so not that much. Now, reason for, what is this? Non response.
07:33 Oh, people do not respond. So, let us see what are the reasons, can you
do again the problem?
07:39 We can, yeah, we can. Now that we know this method, what are the
reasons?
07:45 Could not be executed. I do not know what that means. Which they could not reach, I think.
07:51 Probably. They could not implement. Or maybe it is could not be executed because
of COVID. Maybe also.
07:57 Household not found. They had an address, but they could not find
a house.
08:03 Can happen. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, happens all the time, I think. Locked. No.
08:09 Yes. Perfect. They went, but there was nobody at home. No failure means actually they got the data. No failure means, okay. The way of saying that they got the data.
08:18 And refused, which means there were people
at home, but they refused to share. But they said I will not give you.
08:25 And blank means what? Nothing, we do not know. Let us see if there are any blanks actually. Maybe there are no blanks. There are no blanks.
08:30 No blanks, okay. Just there as an option. It is just that is all. But why, because. Because I have selected the whole thing.
08:38 You selected the whole thing. That is why you got blank. So, this is of course district again, straightforward.
08:46 Yeah, district inside the state. Yeah, this is northwest. Some districts may not have any data responsible.
08:55 Correct. Then? Response status. Is what? Means either did they give the data or they
did not give the data.
09:03 But we saw that refused not, what is the thing
something? Non-failure. So, if you see, if you say accepted, then
wherever it says accepted.
09:13 There will be no failure. There will be no failure. However, if it says non-response, then you
will get different reasons for non-response.
09:23 Actually, intuitively to me this I should
have come before g.
09:30 Correct. Then it would have been easier to understand. It would have been easier to understand.
09:35 Then what do we have after that? Family shifted.
09:42 It means did people change their address I
guess. I see.
09:50 Something. This is something that I do not understand. It says stratum. Again, it is a geographical indicator.
09:57 Which is I think it is some combination of
geography and income levels, I suspect, but
10:04 I do not know. PSU ID also I do not understand. It is some encoding I think that they have
for some statistical, how they got the sample.
10:17 This is the household weight. So, they have the sum of the weights of all
the members in the household.
10:25 How do they determine the weights? They also have.
10:32 Anyway, we are not going to use those fields
presumably. Are you using those fields?
10:38 I do not think so. So we can skip those.
10:43 Then what is it? Then they have age group. That is an interesting one. What is the age group?
10:48 Age group. Age group. What is that? Let me say balanced household with no seniors.
11:04 Balanced household with seniors, children
dominant, grown up dominant, other households
11:12 of the young, other meaning it is probably
some 20 year olds all living together.
11:17 So, you could just have some family that has
got married, husband and wife saying hello. Or it could be. Or it could be.
11:23 Or it could be. Or it could be. Or it could be old people living. Some 4 guys who have just recently got a job
sharing an apartment.
11:31 Or a house could be. Correct. Yeah, there is all these kinds of things. All these kinds of things. I see.
11:37 Okay. Other households of grown ups, senior dominant,
youngsters dominant.
11:42 I see. Okay. So, some. Some color.
11:48 Some color. So, you will know if it is a elderly house. Correct. Then certain kinds of things will probably
get consumed.
11:54 Youngsters means they probably eat less. Correct. They will eat out more. Correct.
11:60 Correct. Something like that. Okay. Occupation. Do you have information like that to eat out
or do you eat at home?
12:07 Yeah, they have. Oh, okay. They have. I see. So, occupation.
12:12 This is, this should also be interesting. So, there are agricultural laborers. Data not available of course. Okay.
12:18 It is fine. Entrepreneurs, industrial workers, miscellaneous,
non-industrial technical employees, organized
12:27 farmers, retired or aged, self-employed entrepreneurs.
12:33 I think we had entrepreneurs here also and
I do not know what is the difference between
12:39 entrepreneurs and self-employed entrepreneurs. Small traders or hawkers.
12:44 I guess entrepreneurs means that they have
a shop or something and self-employed entrepreneurs
12:50 might be, I do not know, like a vegetable
supplier or something. No, that they actually have a different category.
12:56 They say small traders or hawkers. Those are the vegetable vendors.
13:02 Okay, something. Something. Small or marginal farmers, support staff,
wage laborers, white collar clerical employees,
13:11 white collar professional employees. So, you get a lot of color actually.
13:17 You get a lot of information. Okay. Education. Again, it tells you what is the predominant
level of education in the household.
13:28 So, everybody in the household is a graduate
or everybody in the household has finished
13:33 10th standard. Majority of the people have finished graduation.
13:40 Some people in the household have finished
graduation. Or they could all be matriculate.
13:47 There is also, by the way, household of all
illiterates. That also says.
13:53 Household of all literates. You could have all illiterate, you could have
all graduate, you could have some graduate, some matriculate. All matriculate.
13:58 All combinations. All combinations. This will be interesting data, I think. We should try and see. We should see whether there is a relation
between this and some consumption.
14:09 Then gender group. So, gender group is what?
14:15 It is female dominated, female majority, male
dominated, male majority, only females balanced,
14:23 balanced. I forgot balanced right at the top. See, if you do individuals, you will get the
gender, but now you have this more basic things.
14:29 Correct. In your house. Correct. But consumption is always by house only. Yes. Most of the consumption is by house.
14:35 It is not individual. Not individual. No. Very interesting. Then I think the size of the household is,
yes, size.
14:43 It tells you how many members are there. Like 4, 5, 6, 7. Biggest household seems to be 7 members.
14:50 That is a big house. It is a joint family. Joint family or probably grandparents, parents
and some kids living together.
14:58 Only people have 4 member families. Let us see. Let us see. I mean, most families would be.
15:05 Probably 3 or 4. 4 or 3, 4 maybe. So, 4 is coming to how many?
15:12 23. 23 out of 100. So, 100 is 4. 4 member.
15:18 Let us look at how many are 3. 3 also is probably quite common.
15:23 We will see later. We should make some chart out of this. We will make some chart. Let me remove this filter.
15:29 What is that minus 19? 19. 19. 19.
15:35 19. 19. 19. 19. 19. 19.
15:41 What is that minus 99? I think when they could not get data, they
fill it up as minus 99. Why would they do that? Why do they leave it blank?
15:47 They could, I guess, but it is just a way
of. I guess, if you leave it blank, you are not
sure they fill it up. Correct. Correct.
15:52 I guess so. So, for a guy to data enter, he knows how
he is doing. So, if you look at non-response, if you look
at non-response, let us just filter on non-response.
15:58 They will all be minus 99? I think so. Let us check.
16:04 No, it says data not available. No, no, that they may have data. Wherever there is number, it will be minus
99.
16:10 Yeah. Oh, I see. So, all the number things they put as minus
99. Minus 99.
16:15 So, that it is a number field. Maybe the entry software allows you to have
a number. Correct. Correct.
16:21 Probably. Minus 99. And let us do the other check also. So, if I say I have got a response, then there
should be no minus 99s, no?
16:35 Is not it? Let us see that. I suppose so. We will see. We are checking.
16:40 We are checking. Yeah, you are right. See, there is no minus 99. Nice.
16:45 So, minus 99 is a proxy for, number proxy
for not, no response. Yeah, but it is good to check, you know, when
you have this kind of hypothesis, you have
16:52 to check both of… But you know, this minus 99 is later on going
to create trouble for us. Let us say you want to add all the… That is true.
16:57 It will add minus 99. That is true. Let us, let us see what happens. Let us see.
17:03 Let me just clear the filter. Or you want to do a count, minus 99 will also
be counted. Yeah, so let us say this is, this is what
total expenditure.
17:12 So, yeah, so it is probably, it is counting
100, and it is probably taking those minus
17:23 99s also. So, when we do some… We should remove those minus 99s. Can you just do it later?
17:30 We can always do find and replace, no? And minus 99… Let us just clean it up.
17:36 There is no data which is going to be minus
99. Correct.
17:41 That is why they put minus 99. Correct.
17:46 Let us remove it. Actually, let us remove it from the entire
sheet.
17:54 Let us remove minus 99, replace all. Replace all. Good.
17:59 6954 replacements, man. So much. So much. So much. So much. So much data was in minus 99.
18:05 But you know, I mean, it is only 100 rows. So, actually, there are so many columns. Correct. Many columns. Correct. That is probably 6.
18:12 How many columns are there, Bheer? How many columns? How many columns? That may be difficult. We can do one thing, GV.
18:17 We can count that one. We can select. One row we can take out. No, no, we can select all the columns, the
first row.
18:25 Count is there, Bheerana. Count, yeah, 191. So, 191 columns. 191 columns. There are a lot of columns.
18:30 So, we can do that. So, we can do that. So, we can do that. So, we can do that. So, we can do that. So, let us take out a lot of data.
18:36 Wow, we are not going to read all the 190. Okay. Next time. I will tell you what we will do.
18:41 Let us copy this and in a new sheet, just
the field headings, I will paste in a format
18:47 that will be easy for us to. What are you doing? So, I copied all the column headings and I
will paste it transposed.
18:57 Transposed. Which means instead of having everything in
columns, I will put everything in rows.
19:05 So, so you are, like a matrix transposed. Yes. You copied the columns and you pasted it.
19:11 As rows. So, this reads nicely. Now, it is easier to read. I think so, yeah. So, let us see what data is there.
19:17 These are the columns, what are the data there? Yeah. Okay, so response you have seen here, it said
something with all that.
19:22 This is now. Now comes the expenditures. Monthly expense. So, this is the total expenditure of the household
for the month.
19:30 But now they are going to tell us the breakdown. And I think for now, they, so for a lot of
this data, they have the total expenditure
19:39 and they have adjusted total expenditure. Yeah, adjusted test by using recency. So, we will, for, I think for this discussion,
we will ignore the adjusted.
19:48 You basically correct it for recency. Correct. Recency effect. Correct. So, the most important thing is how much do
people spend on food?
19:58 Must be most of the expense. Most of the expense. We will see. We will see. We will see.
20:04 So, first group is. You say 50 percent is food? Probably. For poor families, it will definitely be,
you know.
20:09 Even for wealthier families, maybe 40 percent
at least. Food, possible, I do not know.
20:15 Now, if you take food itself, you can further
break it down. How much was on cereals and pulses? Rice and wheat and all that.
20:23 So, you can see, no, it is not just atta,
see it is whole grains. Whole grains would be rice or wheat.
20:31 Wheat. But atta would be processed cereals. So, they separately put it. They separately put it.
20:36 So, rice and wheat. Yeah. And then you may grind it yourself. Correct. You may cook rice, of course, you cook leather
only.
20:43 Correct. Then you have pulses. Pulses. Then you have edible oils. Edible oils. You have ghee.
20:49 Ghee. Dry spices. Dry spices. Dry spices, I guess is masala. Masala stuff.
20:55 Must be. And then you have got vegetables and wet spices. Wet spices, I suppose would be coriander leaves,
ginger leaves, garlic, things like that.
21:04 Then you have. Vegetables, fruits. Yeah, your fruits. You have dry fruits and saffron.
21:11 Oh my god. Saffron, they could have that. Saffron is not a spice. No, they. Saffron is a flower.
21:18 Potatoes and onions. Milk and milk products. Potatoes and onions. Milk and milk products.
21:24 Milk and milk powder. Powder, maybe. And milk products they have got separately
which is probably curd and.
21:31 People who do not have access to milk must
be converted to milk powder. May be in difficult places. What difficult place? Hotel and all will be converted.
21:39 Correct. Correct. That is true. Who knows what they do with milk? They produce milk powder and milk, I think.
21:45 Yeah. Monthly expense on Mithai. Mithai is the, for some places Mithai is the
must, no? Could be.
21:51 As Bengal and Delhi. Yeah, probably. Monthly expense on bread. Yeah, more increasingly becoming an important.
21:57 Biscuits. Biscuits. Snacks. Salty snacks. Noodles and flakes. That is corn flakes I guess.
22:03 Corn flakes, pasta. Noodles and pasta. Muesli, muesli. Muesli and oats. Chocolate cake ice cream.
22:08 Wow. Ice cream. Man, the level of detail is just amazing,
no? Chocolates and cake. This must take a lot of time to collect.
22:16 Crazy, no? Each time you ask, huh? How much you will draw, Clyde? Yeah. Yeah.
22:22 One hour they will be collecting data list. Ice cream. Ice cream. Jam, ketchup and pickles. There must be an army to collect data, huh?
22:28 Meat, eggs and fish. This will be interesting to see, no? Meat, meat and fish, eggs.
22:35 Which states are? Yeah, we should, we should take a look at
that. Some states do not take meat.
22:42 Some states. Tamil Nadu eats lot of meat and fish. Is it? It is coastal, no?
22:47 Probably. Kerala, Tamil Nadu. West Bengal, Bihar. West Bengal, Andhara, Odisha. What is it? Fish especially.
22:53 Fish, yeah. Gujrat and Rajasthan must be eaten. Correct, correct. Let us see. Probably. We will find out.
22:59 We will find out. Then? Monthly expense on ready to eat food. Tea, coffee, sugar, beverages and water.
23:05 Water. Bottled water. See, actually in Bangalore lot of people buy
bottled water actually because the quality
23:10 of water is so poor. Lot of people buy. Baby food. If you have babies, you have baby food.
23:16 Correct. And then one catch all other foods. Other foods.
23:21 Then monthly expense on intoxicants. Booze. Booze, cigarettes I guess. Yeah, cigarettes and tobacco. That is also intoxicant.
23:29 Beadies. I see. Other tobacco products, snuff I guess.
23:35 There is probably in rural areas, snuff maybe. They chew also. Yeah, they chew.
23:41 That I guess will get counted here, no? Cigarettes and tobacco.
23:47 Yes. Chewing tobacco is probably. Yeah, monthly expense on liquor.
23:54 Then monthly expense on clothing and footwear. Footwear. I see. So, whole bunch of categories there.
23:59 Clothing accessories, artificial jewellery,
bags, wallets, crazy man, cosmetics, dental care products, toothpaste, tooth powder, toothbrush.
24:05 How are people going to remember whether in
December 1990, asking me until 20, I will
24:10 rather I bought. Very difficult. How will, how do they get this data? They will not remember. No. They will say something.
24:16 They will say okay, I mean on average. On and on average. On and on average. On the average, I buy maybe 1, 2, 3, very
much. I do not know. I mean something like that.
24:22 Air oil, shampoo, conditioner. Powder, creams, deodorant. Maintaining the records, bills, they have
something, I do not know. Then appliances. They buy something. They buy something.
24:28 They buy something. They buy something. They buy something. They buy something. They buy something. They buy something.
24:34 They buy something. They buy something. They buy something. Appliances. They buy online, so you can always go back
and check.
24:42 Probably. But I am sure in villages people maybe do
not know.
24:49 They will probably have better records, I
do not know. Maybe.
24:55 Maybe. Actually. Yeah, because they will keep accounts. We do not know.
25:01 Kitchen appliances. Household appliances, mobiles. See you are asking, restaurants eating out.
25:07 How much do they spend on eating out? Correct. So, food in restaurants, living out.
25:14 Now, of course, CD is gone. Entertainment, toys, bills and rent, house
rent, food.

bus, train and ferry, outstation taxi bus
26:00 train, auto rickshaw and cab, airfare, parking
fees, toll charges, communication and info,
26:11 that is probably phone bills, landline phone,
cell phone, cable TV, internet. My goodness, fully.
26:17 Good and fast now. What is the hobby? Hobby classes, school transport, yes, school
transport B1.
26:24 Correct. Overseas education, other education, health,
medicine, doctor. This is a big one, health will be a big one
I think.
26:33 Hygiene products, fitness, parlour spa, oh
yeah, they go for fitness, lot of people do
26:43 that. EMI for house, EMI for vehicle.
26:49 Wow. And then miscellaneous. How much you spend on domestic? Very important.
26:56 Motor vehicle repair, rent. Remittances. Remittances, remittances sent.

27:16 Pets. Oh man, okay. Pets. Pets, people spend lot of money on pets also.
27:24 Yeah, yeah. Okay. So, this is very extensive data.
27:29 It is very extensive. Very extensive data. Very extensive data. Okay, so, but I mean, we will see, I think
we will do some statistics on this later.
27:41 First thing that I am very curious, G.V. But one thing I want, I am not fully satisfied,
even though I have so many feels.
27:52 What more would you like? No, no, I mean, see, if I am trying to do
a calculation of, I want to find out whether
27:58 I want to sell a product or not. It is not enough for me to know whether the
person has consumed toothpaste or not.
28:05 It is not enough. I want to know whether the guy is wanting
to buy toothpaste. Okay, toothpaste. Yeah.
28:10 No, I understand, I get your picture, but
you know television. If he bought toothpaste last month, the chances
are he will buy toothpaste.
28:18 So, I can see that there is a predictability. No. But if you take like say, motorbike.
28:24 Yeah. It is not like he is buying motorbike every
month or something. Yeah, I mean. He either has a motorbike, he does not have
motorbike, most likely.
28:31 Correct. Now, for the guys who do not have motorbike,
I want to know whether they are going to buy motorbike or not. One way to look at that is to see how much
does the guy spend on transport.
28:40 Oh, okay. On public transport. But still that does not tell me whether he
has an intention to buy motorbike.
28:48 No, it does not. It does not. No. So, why do not they ask questions about what
are you likely to do rather than just.
28:55 Actually, I think there is another data set
perhaps where they do. Shall we look at that?
29:00 What is that? I am not sure. Let us check. There is another data set that given us called
aspirational India.
29:10 Aspirational India? Yeah. R sample that is called. What does India aspire to?
29:15 Using R. Same households? May not be, no. I think let us see.
29:22 The sample they have given us may not be.
29:27 No, I do not think so. Let us see if this household ID, let us see.
29:34 It will be interesting for students to try
and put the two data sets together if I do
29:44 not know. But of course, households have to be common. Correct. No. It is not the same households.
29:50 Because these are two samples. I think maybe if you had the full data sets,
then it would what you are saying could have
29:56 been interesting. What does this contain? Can we take the headings of these?
30:02 Yeah, we can do that. We can do exactly what we did last time. You copy it. And then open a sheet.
30:11 And then you paste a transpose. Paste transpose. Paste special. Paste special. In that you select special.
30:16 And here you click transpose. I see. How many are there in this?
30:26 287. Oh my. That had 190, this is 287.
30:33 Oh my God. I do not think they are doing it at the same
time. Can you check? Maybe they do it at different.
30:39 Maybe, no, I do not know. This is also for December 19 or what data?
30:44 Month slot. They have probably done it at roughly the
same time, much even.
30:53 But they are same time, but it is asked about,
it is about future.
30:59 It is not about December 19. Correct. So, you know the same time. Yeah, because I mean, you visit a house, you
try to get as much.
31:05 As much data. You have to go quite far to get to some household. Correct. So, if you look at this, what is this?
31:12 So, I think some of the initial fields are
very similar. So, aspiration means that they are asking
the house what they are aspiring for, aspirations.
31:20 What are they? Intending to. Intending to buy, I guess. Or what do they wish to buy.
31:26 What they want to buy, wish to buy. Wish to. Whether they buy or not. Correct. Depends on the income.
31:31 God knows. Depends on many things. So, I think the first 17 fields, 18 fields
are probably the same.
31:37 There is now a new column here called income
group, which was not there earlier.
31:43 Because income is not, they have total expenditure
there. That was expenditure, this is income.
31:51 Total expenditure will tell you how much they
spend, total income will tell you how much they earn. So, let us look at what is the income.
31:56 If you had both the data sets together, you
would normally be saved. It will be correct. But there you have also how much saved.
32:02 We have saving? No, there we do not. It is only expenses, I think. No saving?
32:08 No savings. Savings, are they here? I think this data set has it. See here, if you see, this is all expense,
completely expense.
32:16 But aspiration will tell you how much you
want to save. How much are you going to spend on motor cycle,
that and all?
32:23 And how much are you going to spend on save
in a fixed deposit? Here, let us see if, let us just go down if
there is savings.
32:39 You can search. Savings.
32:45 What did I do?
32:51 Control F. Has outstanding savings in fixed
deposits.
32:57 Has saved in fixed deposits. Will save in fixed deposits. Has outstanding savings in post office.
33:04 So, person who has savings are likely to save
more, you can check like that.
33:10 Maybe. So, what do they have? They have fixed deposits, they have post office,
they have NSE bonds.
33:18 NSE bonds are big. KVP, Kishan Vikas Patra, Provident Fund, Life
Insurance. Many people have life insurance actually.
33:25 And then? Let us see. Let us go down. Mutual funds, listed shares.
33:32 Why not? Business. They have their own business. They have their own business and they put
savings in that.
33:40 Gold, gold is a huge one. Huge one. Huge one. Very big.
33:45 Very big. Gold. Real estate. Really. Another big one. Another big one.
33:51 Gold and real estate would be the two big
ones. Chit funds. Chit fund will be another one. Another bit. Another one. Correct.
33:57 Other financial instruments. Oh, then they have borrowings also. So, they have savings and they have borrowings.
34:02 So, what have you borrowed for? You have borrowed for housing, education,
medical expenses, lot of people forced to
34:11 borrow for a medical expense. Correct. Wedding. Wedding. Consumption expenditure.
34:17 I do not know about this. You cannot plan for medical. Insurance, I think some people.
34:22 Insurance is there, but. Insurance. So, they will borrow or they will sell their
gold. Correct. So, they will borrow.
34:27 So, they will borrow or they will sell their
gold. Correct. These are two things. Correct.
34:32 Consumer durables, borrowed for business,
borrowed for investments.
34:39 Oh, wow. Borrowed for debt repayment. That guy is in trouble, man.
34:44 If you are borrowing to repay debt. Because you have. So much debt that to settle off one loan you
are taking a new loan.
34:53 Tough. Tough. Borrowed for vehicles. I think this lot of people do.
35:00 People buy cars, people buy two-wheelers. Most of times people buy. Other purposes.
35:05 Now they are saying where did you borrow from? Borrowed from bank and for what purpose?
35:13 Borrowed from money lender and for what purpose?
35:19 Borrowed from employer. This also lot of people do actually. For what purpose?
35:27 Borrowed from relatives and friends, very
common again.
35:34 Borrowed from NBFC. What is NBFC? Non-banking finance company.
35:39 What is an example? Bajaj finance. Bajaj finance. Okay. Okay.
35:44 Yeah. So, if I went to buy a refrigerator and somebody
came and offered me a loan for a refrigerator, I would have said that I would have been most
likely.
35:53 It is not a bank usually, many times not a
bank.
35:60 Correct. Got it. Got it. So, they do not have a banking license, they
have what is called an NBFC license.
36:08 I see. Self-help group, microfinance. Yeah, microfinance. Actually, microfinance is separate. Self-help group is separate, microfinance
separate.
36:13 Self-help group itself will draw money from
microfinance. Shit funds. Shit funds, again, a lot of people borrow
from shit funds also.
36:20 Yes, yes, yes, they do that. Credit cards. Credit card is for urban people, yeah.
36:26 Yes. Yes. Borrowed from shops. Oh, I see, because credit they keep in shops.
36:31 Correct. Wow. Interesting. Very interesting. Restaurants, shops, all keep credit many times.
36:36 Yeah. And then the final one is borrowed from other
sources. Okay. At other, so I think that is more like a catch
all, I think.
36:43 Yeah, from friend and family. Early finances compared to a year ago.
36:49 So, this is judgment, right? Are you better off today than you were a year
ago? I see.
36:55 Do you think you will be better off a year
from now? Okay. Those are the kind of questions.
37:01 Okay. Do you think the country will be better off
in the next one year? I see, okay.
37:07 Even the profits can say okay. You ask credit, probably they have better
sense, who knows?
37:12 Correct. Is this a good time to buy consumer durables? Yeah, yes, good question. What type of roof, type of wall?
37:17 What kind of house are you living in? Has electricity. What kind of house are you living in?
37:24 Power availability in hours per day. Man.
37:30 Can we go back and see what is it they want
to buy? Are they buying? Let us see. Are they going to buy a refrigerator? That is there before savings.
37:37 AC or? Yeah, that is there actually. Do they want to buy a two wheeler? If you just go beyond this.
37:43 So, are they going to buy scooter or motorcycle
like that we can say? Let us see. So, the first thing they ask is houses owned.
37:51 How many houses does this household own? Okay. Is that it? Have they bought a house or do they intend
to buy a house and if they are intending to
38:02 buy a house. Will they buy now? Buy now or later? Later. Oh, wow.
38:07 Okay. Wow, this is detailed. And. It is a useful piece of information. The next one. Do I think it is a good time to buy a house?
38:14 Even if I do not intend to buy. But it is a good time to buy. But it could be a good time to buy because
I think house prices will go up.
38:21 Maybe but also maybe I do not have money. Or maybe I do not have money. This is for a guy who is going to lend money. Correct.
38:27 Correct. You do not want to go to a guy who is going
to buy a house and he has got the money. Correct. You want to go to a guy who is going to need
a loan.
38:33 Who thinks it is a good time to buy a house
but does not have the money. Correct. That is the guy you have to.
38:38 Correct. And this same pattern you will see for all
the data. So, do they have refrigerator?
38:45 Have they bought a refrigerator? Have they bought a refrigerator recently? Will they buy a refrigerator? If so, will they buy it now?
38:52 Is it a good time to? Good time to buy. Okay. Now the same pattern we will repeat.
38:58 Air conditioners, coolers. Coolers. See North India, lot of people use coolers
in the summer. Desert.
39:03 Rajasthan and all. They do not buy air conditioners.
39:08 Washing machines. Television. Television is definitely going to be something. Correct.
39:14 Computers. Oh, computer DJs. Kids want cars. Cars.
39:20 Cars. You are asking cars or two wheelers? Cars or two wheelers. Two wheelers.
39:25 Two wheelers. And then they have asked what kind of two
wheeler do you own? Type of two wheeler. Do you own a scooter or a motorcycle?
39:31 Brand also. Brand is there. Brand I do not think is there. Too many brands.
39:37 So, I looked at, I took a look at it. No, well actually the brand information would
be useful for the brand company.
39:46 So, if I was TVS. It will be but yeah, maybe yeah.
39:51 But more than that is category I think. Yeah, category is. Is it a scooter or motorcycle?
39:57 I think broadly if you know that. Or a moped. By the way there is something called moped.
40:04 So, moped, scooter or motorcycle. So, here is what it is showing. So, one category is Bajaj City, Bajaj Platino,
Hero Splendor, blah, blah, blah.
40:12 Motorcycle. This seems like a motorcycle kind of thing. Then the next is Honda Activa, TVS.
40:18 Scooter. This is scooter. TVS Apache, Bajaj Avenger. I think these are big motorcycles.
40:23 These are 200 cc plus. Small motorcycle, big motorcycles.
40:29 These are probably like 100 cc. They do not have moped. They do not seem to have moped. Moped maybe it is gone in the category.
40:37 Maybe it is gone. 50 cc or 60 cc. They used to be very popular once upon a time. Because you do not need license to drive some
of them.
40:43 That is why. People carry lot of weight also on that actually. Lot of people also sit on that.
40:50 Then it will go at 10 kilometers an hour. Correct.
40:55 So, let us go back to our. So, this is an interesting sheet.
41:00 So, what are we seeing? In this sheet we are seeing intent to. By the way, look, look, look.
41:05 Cattle. Cattle tractor I saw. Tractor, cattle, genset. Very rich data.
41:12 Very rich data. Now, of course, then after that was savings,
which we looked at already.
41:18 So, between these two data sets, consumption
data set, what have you consumed in the some
41:25 period, some month? And what are you intending to do or what do
you own now and what are you intending to
41:31 buy? Are you going to buy a car or whatever it
is? Are you going to save? So, where are you going to save?
41:38 What have you saved? Are you more a fixed deposit type or are you
just share buying type, share purchase type?
41:45 Based on that, I think a lot of analysis can
be done. So, I was already thinking, you know, Jeevi,
you had this question, maybe we should spend
41:51 some time thinking about this two wheelers. If there is somebody who is spending a lot
on public transport, does not have a two wheeler
42:04 today, but thinks it is a good time to buy
a two wheeler. Because it will reduce the cost.
42:11 Correct. Maybe. It should. Maybe. I mean, of course, they have to spend money
on the two wheelers. Also, but there is comfort.
42:17 This you will save time. You will save time. It is more, you will save time and it will
reduce your cost overall.
42:25 Maybe we should at some point spend some time
looking at these two pieces of data and. Put it together.
42:30 We should do that. We should do that. Maybe that is something we can do.
42:37 Yep.
