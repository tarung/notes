00:15 So, we got, we had a look at the 
data, consumption data. One question,  
00:20 one thought that came when we were 
looking at the data was, can we plot   a nice pie chart? For example, we want to look at 
the households with different numbers of family  
00:32 members. So, those households which have only 
2 people, 1 people, 7 people, 6 people like  
00:39 that. So, that was. Pie chart looks like a nice 
weighted representative, I thought. Yes, probably.
00:45 So, can we, how do we do that? They had   household group size. So, where was that household 
group size? Let us see. Age group. Age group.
01:05 Age group. We said we will do 
it by age. Not age actually,   we want to do it by number of people in the 
house. That is there in the other data set,  
01:13 it is not there in both data 
sets. Really? Yeah, I think so. Size group is there here, it is not there in the 
other one. We can do it in this one first. We can  
01:24 do that. If we want to do that, first is we have 
to find out where is the size group. Size group.
01:35 The size group. So, you want somewhere 
this list, 1 member, 2 members, 3 members,  
01:43 4 members, 5 members, 7 members. Not 
all, data not available, we do not want,   blank we do not want. Blank we do not 
want. Yeah, 1, 2, yeah that is correct.
01:53 So, the way we have to do this 
is, let us go to this sheet.   And so we will. You selected that 
thing. What do you do? I have just  
02:03 gone into an empty cell. Then you go into data. So, basically what do we want? We want the 
set of unique values in this column. You  
02:13 want the unique values in this column. Correct? 
Yeah, yeah. You want the labels in this column. Yes. Unique labels because 
they could be repeated. So,  
02:22 if I look at 1 member. But you cannot 
do it through the filter drop down list,   you cannot do it. Yeah, you can, you would 
then have to do it manually. You would have to.
02:28 You cannot copy from it. With this you 
cannot copy, this list you cannot copy.   So, you would have to copy 1 member, etcetera. 
But let us see if we can do it automatically.  
02:38 So, you go here, you go to data. And then in data, you go into advanced. And then 
you say copy the data to another location. Now,  
02:52 what is the data we want to copy? We want to 
copy the data that is there. Let us first just  
02:58 rename this just 1 moment. Just to make our 
life simpler, we will call this main sheet.
03:06 So, here we will say advanced, copy to 
another location. What is the sheet we  
03:14 want? We want the data that is there in 
main R2 to R101. No, sorry, W, W, W. W2 to.
03:26 W2 to W101. Correct? And we want to copy 
it to this cell, beginning this cell.  
03:44 But we want unique records only. Oh, you are 
copying it without copying duplicates. Correct.  
03:50 It is just using copy basically. Yes. Yes, copy. Copy the records 
without duplicates. Let us see.  
03:58 Very nice. I do not know why 
data not available came twice   though. It is just 1 without a and 
1 something, some spelling problem.
04:04 Spelling problem. Remove it. Remove it. 
We do not want it. We do not want that. Remove that. The rest are okay. 5, 4, 3, 2. 
And then this also let us sort. It is got all.
04:14 It is your bunches. We will just sort. We will 
sort ascending. Nice. Now I want to count.
04:23 Now let us count. So, you know, I discussed with 
the students a function called countif. Countif.
04:30 Countif. Countif. Countif. And we want 
to count from. Means w1 to. W1 to w 101.
04:42 W2 or 1? W2. W2 to w 101. And I should 
put, first of all, this should be main.  
04:56 And then this should be dollar 2. We want 
absolute addresses, not relative addresses.  
05:05 And then the criteria should be this one. Correct. Yeah, criteria is one member. 
So, only one household has one member.  
05:15 When you go to the next one, then 
it should be counting compared. Just check. Check. Go to the, one 
of them is check. What is it? Check.  
05:23 Oh, you are checking the filter you are 
going to do? Yeah. We can check with filter. So, if I look at one member. Yeah, 
correct. Let us look at two members.  
05:39 There are 10. Have you got 10? Nine. Okay, that 
is, I think it counted the size group also.
05:47 So, we should ignore that. Yeah, nine. Nine. 
All right. So, it seems to be correct. Let us   just check once randomly, four members. Oh, 
this should be the maximum, no? This is 23.
06:00 23. 23. All right. Do a sum of all 
of them and let us say percentage.  
06:07 This if we take, so this is 62, we can say 62.  
06:17 Now, you want percentage. So, this if you 
want percentage, this is going to be equal to  
06:27 this divided by dollar m, then dollar 10.
06:43 And we will format this as  
06:50 percent. Correct? Now, make a pie chart. We 
can remove that first column. No, we actually  
06:56 do not need percentages to do the pie chart. 
Yeah, we could, I guess, if I could do that.
07:04 We do not need. We could try, let us try. 
Let us just see if we can do it with this.  
07:10 Actually, it should be percentage. 
It should do. So, it will just.   Why are we doing percentage? 
You are right actually. Right. Absolutely. And if we do the 
data labels, let us say data labels,  
07:21 add data labels. Nice. And you can 
format the data labels, I think. So,  
07:26 actually the pie chart is 
already doing percentage. Correct. And we can say 
instead of showing show value,  
07:32 you can say show percentage. 
Oh, you do not, without doing,   it will do it for a second. It will do the 
percentage itself. Oh, well, so that saves time.
07:41 It saves a lot of time. So, what is 
it saying 19 percent? Where are we   now? One member is very small. This 
is, I think, where we start. Right.
07:50 This is 1.  
07:59 Then this is, 2 members is 14 percent. 3 members 
is 19 percent. 4 members is 37 percent. 5 members   is 24. We had a lot of. So, this 3 to 5 is 
actually seems to be the average household. It is. 4 plus minus 1 kind of thing. 
And freshly married or something.  
08:17 Freshly married maybe 2. Or maybe 2 bachelors 
living together. 2 bachelors living together. Very few are above 6, 6 or above. 
And very few are living alone.  
08:27 Now, so this is nice, very nice. I like this 
chart. Presentation purpose is always nice to put.
08:33 It shows the data set. It shows what 
kind of data we have. No, and you know,   I think most people go to sleep if they look at 
numbers. They see some visual representation,  
08:41 then suddenly the message comes out. Much 
more clearly. So, if we can. By the way,  
08:46 just as an exercise, we could 
show this as a bar chart also.
08:54 Let us see if we can do that. We can 
change. Is that good to do? Let us see.  
09:03 Maybe it is kind of conveys it 
in a slightly different way.  
09:09 You can see that it peaks in the middle 
and comes down. Like that you can see. So, you can see like a Gaussian distribution.   Correct, correct, correct, which you cannot 
see in the picture. Correct. Very true.
09:18 It is like a Gaussian distribution. 
That is another view of it. Different,  
09:24 different message is coming out. Different message 
is coming out. Depending on what you need to   convey. Correct. So, can we instead of doing this 
number of members, can we do this thing called,  
09:39 what is it, age group or age group 
might be interesting or age group   is there in both? I want to actually 
see whether the data sets are similar.
09:46 Sort of consistent. Between the two data sets. We 
can see. Can we do age group in both? We can do   age group. Is there in both? I think this is what 
consumption, the other one was aspirational India,  
09:57 age group is there. Age group is there. So, 
let us do age group in both, same method. Same method we will do, we will do 
here. So, what do we do? We say data  
10:08 advanced, copy to another location. Here we are 
going to say age group is what, s. We will say,  
10:21 not sheet 1, main exclamation s2, 
sorry s dollar 2, no? Yeah, 2 s 101.
10:35 2 s dollar 1. Yeah.  
10:45 And then I want unique. Yeah. What happened? I did 
something funny. You did not say which location,  
10:56 so it overwrote on that. Yeah, that is okay. 
We can just do that and then here instead of.
11:09 You can delete that percentage, we do not need 
it. We do not need the percentage, delete that,  
11:14 sorry, del, not backspace. This is the del, I 
find this keyboard a little confusing. Yeah.  
11:25 It is clear I guess, the cells, 
Excel also took care of the cells. And here instead of looking in w, I should 
look inside s, no? Yeah. Yeah. So, w to s.  
11:56 Yeah. Now the same thing I 
will do in the other sheet.
12:04 Yeah, yeah. This little bit like this, bar chart 
only. Bar chart is interesting, no? Let us look  
12:11 at the other one. So, it says basically, just 
here that bar chart, Sushumesh bar chart again.   It says that youngsters dominant 
5, grown up dominant 25.  
12:21 So, grown up dominant and balanced household 
seem to be the? Largest with no seniors.
12:27 Correct. Nuclear family basically. Nuclear 
families. Senior dominant is only 2,  
12:32 small number. That is what it 
is. But I think that will change   as India gets older. When you see the 
aspirational data, I want to understand.
12:39 This aspirational or the other one? No, 
this is, this is consumption. Let us see   the aspiration. Let us look at the aspiration. 
Can you copy that from there to here? No,  
12:49 no, no, you will need to do it again because 
you are looking at different columns and so on. Okay, okay, okay. Categories will also be there. 
Again, we will have to go to data, advanced, copy  
13:02 to another location. What do we want? We want, 
we want age group we want to, this is age group.
13:09 This is R. R. I think the categories 
are the same, but. 2, dollar R 101. So,  
13:21 it is, it says sheet, what sheet is it? It is not 
saying me, it is sheet. That is good, I can see.  
13:42 And then we have to say, correct, 
no? Some error is there in that. Where? Why? I have to say colon.  
13:53 No, there is already a colon. I think 
just you have to retype, retype it.
13:58 It is a error. R2, no? R2. So, when you do that,  
14:08 I think. I see, let me just redo it. 
Because when your cursor is on the sheet,  
14:16 this is a standard problem I think in 
Excel. It kind of over designed I think.
14:22 This is the age group. R2 to colon $ R. No, 
it is already come, something came already.  
14:33 If you are on that sheet, that is what 
happens. You should not be on the sheet.  
14:38 Click the cursor here, I 
think that is alright. R2 to  
14:44 R1, do not, you do not have to click on 
that sheet, do not click on that sheet.
14:50 No, what do you want me to do? No, no, I think you 
should stay on this sheet. You should have to go   into that sheet. So, long as you know it is R2 to 
R 102, you can just type it, I think it is easier.
15:02 Dollar R dollar 101. Yeah, unique record, sorry.  
15:16 Let me just do this. Main exclamation 
dollar R dollar 2 colon dollar R  
15:27 dollar 101. Should I remove the 
filter maybe? Does not like the  
15:38 filter. Data.  
16:00 Advanced copy to another location. I think this I will say, main exclamation 
or maybe I had not clicked copy to another  
16:16 location. Yeah, that is what I was saying. 
Dollar R dollar 101, copy to this one.  
16:27 Unique record, sorry. Yes. Now here I 
will say, count if dollar R22, main name,  
16:44 exclamation dollar R dollar 2 colon 
dollar R dollar 101 comma, yeah.
17:01 What happened to extract? I2. Yeah,  
17:17 make up bar chart.  
17:30 This is shape is a little different.   Are they the same order? No, I should remove data 
not available. Data not available I will remove.  
17:50 So, here balance households with seniors is quite 
a lot actually. Balance households, no, sorry.
17:56 Can you put both the charts in the same place? I 
will delete this one. Put the charts one by the  
18:03 other.  
18:11 This chart, no?  
18:32 So, youngster dominant. So, 
I can do one thing for you.
18:37 Let me just copy this. What is the order? 
They want youngster dominant first.  
18:48 Let me just copy this here.   Control C, control V. Now what is the 
first one they want? Youngster dominant.
19:03 Then they want grown up dominant. Correct? Yeah. 
Then they want balanced household with no seniors.  
19:18 Other household of grown ups, senior dominant,  
19:27 balanced household with seniors. That is 
not there in the… Different categories.  
19:33 I think leave it, it is alright. We can compare one to one. So, youngster dominant 
is more or less like that only. 6 says 5. Grown  
19:40 up dominant here it is 30, there it is 25. Here 
there is 10 balanced households with no seniors.
19:46 Here it is 19. Shape is kind of more or 
less. Shape is, but they are different   samples. Different samples. Sampling has 
been different. This is interesting anyway.   We have to check like this because you may 
be driving some. And this also tells you,  
20:05 just looking at the bar chart you were 
able to get quite a few things immediately.
20:10 Correct. Correct, correct. So, what 
do you mean probably harder if you  
20:15 are just trying to look at numbers, 
probably have struggled much more. Is not it? Visual is always better. Visual is 
better. So, this is good. This is a good exercise.  
20:27 So, what do you… Now, what else can we look 
at? We can look at, what do people in villages  
20:35 consume versus what do people in… What is 
the consumption pattern for example? Correct.  
20:41 Is that easy to do? Or let us put it like 
this. I mean consumption pattern is too   complicated, there are too many parameters 
I think. Out of the total consumption,  
20:49 how much people are consuming on food? That we 
can do. Can we do the simple method? Is there a  
20:54 simple method? Yeah, I think now there are, 
you want to do this, so here is what we can do.
21:05 So, the, we want to see the distribution of, 
not distribution, distribution is too much.  
21:11 Percentage consumption on food. You want average 
or you want weighted average? What is weighted  
21:19 average? I mean weighted average 
weighted by the consumption.
21:25 Consumption. That is just too average, I mean   let us just calculate the total consumption. 
Let us just say simple. Total consumption,  
21:32 total consumption on food and divide. So, 
if you look at this. That is the first cut. They have some data for total expenditure and 
they have monthly expense on food. That is all,  
21:42 divide one. We just divide one by the other. Total, the total. No, no, that, hold on. We 
will come to that. That is all we will do. We  
21:48 will come to that. Then we will filter and we 
will do things. We will filter and do things.   We will do this for each row.
21:55 So, now what I will do is, I will just insert 
a column here. Actually I can do it at the end,  
22:00 but it will be difficult. You are taking the, 
you are going to take average of the percentages.   That also you can do. Yeah, that is what you will 
do, no? Or you can take the percentage directly.
22:11 Take the total consumption. You can 
do that also. Total, it is the same   answer I guess. It will get, it 
should give you the same answer.
22:17 I guess so. We do not know. No, it will not 
be the same. That because the, some of the   numerators are not. That will be weighted. That 
will be something else. Some of the numerators by  
22:28 some of denominators is not equal to numerator 
by denominator plus numerator by denominator. It is not like that. Is not it? A plus B by 
C plus D is not A by C plus B by D. Correct.
22:38 We will get something else. So, 
let us, let us do this. This is.  
22:47 14 percent, 14, 34, 35 percent. 
35 percent. Is spent on food. That household. That household. Let us do it for  
22:55 all the others. You are in the 
middle of the sheet. I have not. There is a filter on I think.  
23:10 Data not available. That is the answer. I will do 
one thing. I will just select here remove blanks.
23:17 Now, it is saying the average is 44.  
23:49 Average of. The average of percentages. 
Average of percentages. Is, so. However,  
23:56 the other thing that I could do. Just divide this by that and see what happens. 
Is say. Some is to think. Some if not blank or.
24:04 Some blank will take us here. Some in this. No 
problem. We will take it as 0. It will do it.  
24:10 Just take some of those two. So, I will say some.
24:25 Actually, this should be x2. This is blank.  
24:37 And the same thing I will copy here. 
What is the total? Now, if I say  
24:53 this divided by this.
24:59 40 percent. That was how much? 44 that was.  
25:05 44. The average of that is 44. 
This is 44. And this one is 41.
25:12 41. 41. 41. 41. Let us this because this 
is weighted by the. Something. Something.
25:19 It is a sum of the variables. A plus B by C 
plus D. Whereas that is A by C plus B by D.  
25:25 Each. Something like that. Correct. Correct. 
It is not the same as A plus C. No. So,  
25:36 anyway it gives you some, if you look 
at between these two you get some. So,   one thing that is clearly obvious immediately is 
that 40 percent of total expenditure is on food.
25:47 The most important category of expenditure 
looks like. Can we do this by urban and   rural? Can we do by just filter or something? 
That is actually possible. Filter it will go.
25:58 So, if I filter, the sum would not change 
actually. So, there is a different formula.  
26:09 If I just say urban, you will see that this 
has not changed. What has not changed? The sum.  
26:20 Because it is still summing all the variables. Because we said sum of x2. 
But there is a different one,  
26:26 there is a different formula. I can do that, I 
can insert a row here and I can say subtotal.  
26:43 And what do I want? I want the sum. So, 
I want, where is sum? Sum was there. Yes,  
26:51 sum. So, I want sum of x3, now it is 3, not 2 
because we have added a row going up to x1, 0, 2.
27:12 And what this is doing, GV, is that it is 
now summing only the cells. So, if you have  
27:19 a filter in the table, then now subtotal will 
sum only the cells that have been displayed.
27:28 So, now let me show you, let us 
change this urban to rural. Just what,  
27:33 just remember what was the number here? 49. 
4.93 lakhs. 4.9 lakhs. 4.9 lakhs roughly.
27:42 This, if I change to rural, now it is 2.94 lakhs. 
Oh, I see. So, the same thing if I copy here,  
27:55 so this was total expense and this is monthly 
expense on food. And then take percentage.
28:01 Then take percentage. So, let me just take,   I will just, this divide by this. This is 
cool here, this is a nice thing actually,  
28:11 very useful. Then do. So, rural percentage 
is 44, we saw 41 percent overall. Correct. So, it means urban percentage of 
food is less. Let us see, let us see. So,  
28:21 we have 41 overall, rural is 
44. Now, let me remove this.  
28:33 39. So, 39 percent of food consumption is on food  
28:39 for urban areas, but 44 percent for 
rural areas and overall it is 41.
28:53 Correct. Very nice. As many do it by this. 
Correct. Total food expenditure by total   consumption. Correct. Interesting. Okay. 
Okay. What else would you like to look at?  
29:02 We will pause. Let us go back to the sheet. 
Milind, we did, I think we got some very good  
29:07 handle on the, how the families are 
broken up by age group or something.
29:14 And we also saw consumption on food, rural versus 
urban. That is what we saw. Now I want some more  
29:21 analysis can we do, similar analysis like this 
consumption of rural urban, we want to do for  
29:27 many other things. Is there a simple way where we 
can do the same kind of analysis? So, let us see,  
29:32 maybe one thing we can do, instead of putting 
this percentage here, let us insert a row above.
29:39 And this percentage number we will put 
on top. Because the same number you are  
29:47 representing is percentage. Correct. And this 
total expenditure is not going to change.
29:53 Put in dollar. So, I will put it in dollar. We 
will say dollar x dollar 2. Yeah, you can do that.  
30:06 So, we got a percentage. And 
I will format this as percent. Subtotal we did. Subtotal, this is subtotal. 
Okay. So, now, this column can be removed. No,  
30:20 I think this is, we had created 
this column. I will delete it.  
30:25 So, now the same formula, we can actually, 
both of these, we can just sort of drag here.
30:34 So, for each category, we will get the subtotal 
and the percentage. I see. Nice way. Okay.  
30:43 So, now if I change the filter, those 
processes will change? Automatically. Let us see. Let us check. It should, 
at least in theory, it should.  
30:52 Let us check if it does. So, 
that, so this is interesting.  
30:57 It is a lot of columns. You cannot do 
that standard trick of… Control, right.
31:03 Okay, we have reached the end. So, monthly 
expense on pets is close to 0 percent.  
31:14 Now, the other problem in a GV is that this has 
too many columns. Hide some columns. Many of  
31:20 these columns are not, you know, this, I do not 
think we are going to use this column anywhere.
31:25 So, I will hide it.   Then this also we are not going to… Right now 
we are not using it. This, this, this, this.  
31:38 A lot of these columns can be hidden. Hide, right.  
31:53 These let us keep. These let us keep. Now, 
tell me what would you, okay, first of all,  
31:59 let us see if… What did we said? We had 
said urban, no? So, change it to rural. Let us say if I change it to rural. And I can 
select both also, no? You can select both also.
32:12 Indeed, you can select both. Numbers changed. 
41. All the numbers changed, you can see.  
32:20 Now, let me change it just to 
rural. Just watch the numbers. Okay.  
32:28 Okay, let us read now. What are we saying here? 
44 percent is better. So, one second before that,  
32:33 what we can do in this case is there 
is this thing called view freeze panes.
32:42 Where is freeze panes? Yes, freeze panes. 
Now, what this gives you an advantage is  
32:48 that as you scroll to the right, or 
let me not freeze panes there. Let  
33:01 us freeze panes here. Freeze 
panes, freeze panes here. Now,   if I scroll to the right, oh, these things to the 
left of the frozen pane do not, are still visible.
33:13 So, now it is become… I want this row also to be 
frozen. It is frozen. It is frozen. It is? It is,  
33:20 it is. You go down. That is 
what I want. This is nice. So,   it becomes easy for us to do the analysis.
33:26 Yeah, yeah, yeah. Now, now tell 
me what analysis you want. No,   I want to see after, so we saw for, this is 
your urban, no? No, we have got everything.
33:34 Yeah, sorry. Just choose rural for a moment. 
You want rural? Just rural only. Rural only.   And I want to see after 
food is the big expenditure,  
33:45 no? Yes. I hope it is the highest. 
I am not sure if it is highest. So, it is 40, what is 49 percent?  
33:54 Oh, that is adjusted. Adjusted. After food, what 
is the next thing they spend money on? I saw 11,  
34:06 sir. 9 percent is milk and milk 
products. That is a subcomponent of  
34:13 food. There was 11, no? That was a part of food. Probably. Was there 11?  
34:22 Yeah, this is monthly expenses in cereals and 
pulses. So, one quarter of the food expenses is  
34:27 cereals and pulses, it is not surprising. Correct. 
And another quarter is milk and milk products. 9 percent is milk and milk products. 
Correct. Out of 44. After 44,  
34:40 what is the next big thing? Methi, bread,  
34:48 food, maybe it is an education or something, 
I do not know. Travel? Let us see.
34:53 Maybe travel, no?  
34:59 Intoxicants, let us see, intoxicants, maybe 
4 other foods, intoxicants. 5 percent is on  
35:11 intoxicants. 5 percent is on intoxicants. 5 
percent on intoxicants. In rural, in rural.
35:21 What is it, urban? Urban, let us see. More? Urban 
should be more, no? I do not know actually, hard.  
35:31 3 percent. It is more in. So, people are 
spending more on food? More on intoxicants.
35:39 And more on intoxicants in rural area? 
Yes, more on food and more on intoxicants.  
35:49 I would not have guessed that. No, no, no, interesting. Intoxicants. Yes, yes. 
It means liquor, may not be liquor. Liquor and  
35:57 tobacco. Tobacco. Tobacco probably, lot of chewing 
tobacco, BDs. Something like that. 5 percent. 5  
36:05 percent is income on intoxicants. 5 percent of 
their income in rural, in urban it is 3 percent.
36:11 What is transport? Transport 
definitely urban is more,   no, do not think? No, see rural people 
have to travel long distances for jobs.
36:24 They do not go anywhere, they work there 
only. We do not know. I do not know. Urban may  
36:30 they travel. Where is travel? They have to 
go there. Where is travel? Let me search. Let me search control F.  
36:42 Travel. What happened? Transport.  
36:52 Transport, I think it is 
called transport. Yes, yes.  
37:02 There is monthly expense on transport. 
In urban it is 2 percent of. And what is it per  
37:15 unit? 4 percent. It is higher. Yeah. So, I 
could do one thing, you know, if you wanted  
37:21 more interesting way of looking at it. It is a 
percentage of income it may be. Let us see what  
37:27 is the average expense? What is that? What is 
the average absolute expense? On? On transport.
37:39 In rural area. In rural area versus urban area. 
So, average is 101. So, you can, the way you are  
37:47 summarizing, right now I am doing sum, I could do 
average. What you will do 3, that? On an average.
37:56 The subtotal. Urban people, rural people 
are spending 404 rupees per month. And  
38:05 urban people. Oh, it may be higher. That may be 
higher. Are spending, no, 265 rupees, 266 rupees.
38:11 Is it? People are spending less in cities on 
transport. That is all the 266 because bus,  
38:18 I do not know. Maybe it is. Maybe they use their 
personal transport only petrol, petrol is shown  
38:23 somewhere else. Maybe. I do not know. No, petrol 
is there in this one. Anyway, so roughly like  
38:33 that, so what 40 odd percent is going on food, 
5 percent on toxicants, 4 percent on transport.
38:38 Let me just, let us, let me change this back 
to 109 because only then I will get 2 percent  
38:46 on transport. No, rural we wanted, no? 4 percent 
it was. 4 percent. So, about 50 percent goes on  
38:57 these 3. It may actually, those people who are 
traveling maybe, I will tell you how it will be. I suspect, rural. Those people who 
are traveling will be spending a  
39:05 lot of money. Those people who are 
not traveling are spending nothing.   But the average is sort of, it 
is like a bimodal distribution.
39:14 Bimodal, bimodal, they call 
a number that they tell you.   Let us see how it looks. It is a bimodal 
distribution. This is the one, no? If you look at.  
39:31 Select only zeros, see what happens. How many are there? Just two. But you see who 
are the guys, small and marginal farmers and  
39:42 wage liberators. I am not traveling. I 
am not traveling. Not afford to travel.  
39:52 This is the one, no? Let me do one thing. I can 
say less than or equal to 100 for households.
40:05 Again small and marginal.   I see. Not 100, it should be less than equal 
to average. Average is, we do not know what  
40:17 the average is, no? We know, no, it was 400 
or something, no? 400 was for the city, 290.
40:23 No, no, 400 was for Rudolf. So, less 
than equal to 400, you should say.  
40:34 So, about 19 people are 
spending less than the average.  
40:42 It is not that, it is not so obvious the pattern. No. Occasionally, they may be traveling, maybe 
they travel once a week. Maybe. But when they  
40:49 travel, they are not spending more. They are 
spending more money. So, let us do one thing.   Let us, no, no, since we looked at it like this, 
let us also look at greater than or equal to 400.
41:03 Here there is, see there is, see numbers 1000,   100. But you can see the difference GV. It 
is organized farmers, industrial workers.
41:10 Who are traveling far. Who are traveling 
far. They are going to some city and   working and going. Correct. That is the pattern. 
It is, you have to look at the occupation group.  
41:22 Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Correct. Something like 
that. Yes. And those guys are then spending. And see for them 6 percent of income is 
going actually. But look at this man,  
41:30 some wage laborer is spending 1000 rupees a month. How much is that person earning 
total? We do not have his income here.  
41:38 We do not have his income. 
He has total expenditure. He has expenditure, yeah. It is 
huge. But it is 6 percent of his  
41:46 expenditure is actually going in. Quite a 
bit. It is quite a lot. It is quite a lot. Yeah. So, we learnt intoxicates there. 
People are consuming a lot. Travel also.  
41:57 Travel also they are consuming a lot. 
So, their savings will not be too much.   They will not be saving much. I do not think 
so. Is not it? Yeah. Alright, useful. Nice.
