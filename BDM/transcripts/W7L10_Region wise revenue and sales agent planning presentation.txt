00:00 [Music]
00:16 so this this right uh ship basically um
00:20 responds to your question on
00:23 breakdown of the revenue by region north
00:26 east west and south
00:28 you try to compute the total revenue for
00:30 19. for that we have only one quarter
00:32 data so we have done it for that one
00:34 quarter
00:36 and
00:36 relating i mean you've given us the data
00:38 actually and then we have seen
00:40 how to compute from there
00:43 potentially the number of agents
00:46 i mean we did a very simple thing the
00:48 absence of any rule
00:50 we just put a
00:53 target for each of the agents
00:56 in terms of sales sales targets
00:58 and then based on that we computed the
01:00 number of agents
01:03 so
01:04 uh that gave us some agents so it said
01:06 four agents for the north four regions
01:08 for the east
01:09 two for the west and four for the south
01:13 uh
01:14 for some reason west seems to have lower
01:16 revenues you can see that in the next
01:18 figure also right
01:20 next
01:22 yeah
01:23 so west seems to have
01:25 i don't know why west has lower revenues
01:27 considering that
01:28 what you mentioned pune bombay being one
01:30 of the clusters
01:32 uh so maybe i mean you can respond to
01:35 these
01:36 charts
01:38 yes
01:39 that's yeah yes absolutely it's a good
01:41 analysis where we're looking at regional
01:44 regional revenues and the focus right so
01:48 uh we can see that on those three months
01:50 of the quarter right definitely it
01:53 appears like the eastern region is is
01:55 quite high and so it's uh
01:58 the northern region uh and this depends
02:00 on the particular mix of customers for
02:02 this particular uh company ace years
02:05 they do a lot of business with some of
02:07 the oems that have big manufacturing
02:10 presence in
02:11 the east like jump ship pool cluster and
02:13 also you know
02:15 in the panthnaga
02:16 auto cluster so that's why you see
02:19 somewhat higher and of course they do
02:20 have supply to the south they don't
02:23 particularly have a strong customer base
02:25 in the west although it is an important
02:28 sector for auto industry so that's
02:30 something they have to work on right
02:31 this also shows
02:33 the previous previous slide
02:36 so
02:38 here we have just simply divided the
02:40 revenue by
02:42 some
02:43 number target and we have got that four
02:45 two four and four
02:47 but strictly speaking when you do
02:49 planning one would probably think that
02:51 we should put more agents invest because
02:53 that's where you want to increase the
02:54 sales right
02:55 yes
02:56 yes i think this is uh probably and yeah
02:59 we could look at a different basis i
03:01 think the way
03:03 uh that
03:04 was worked out by the teamers they said
03:06 look uh we will give we will appoint
03:09 agents
03:10 where based on the on the existing sales
03:12 quantity to make sure the customer
03:14 services
03:15 is improved and all that and i think
03:18 for every 4 000
03:20 units they wanted to find one agent
03:23 something like that right so that's
03:24 that's what the distribution is
03:27 this is i think
03:29 yeah yeah
03:31 the
03:31 agent is actually to grow new business
03:33 not just take take care of existing
03:35 business then we should probably focus
03:38 more on the westward there is a good
03:40 base manufacturing auto industry and we
03:43 don't yet have good enough sales right
03:46 so the sales agent should actually be
03:48 higher but this could be like customer
03:50 service agents who are just taking care
03:51 of
03:52 existing business like making sure that
03:55 the the shipments are reaching on time
03:57 and logistic issues are worked out and
03:59 invoicing is handled properly
04:02 and collections are handled properly
04:04 those types of things
04:06 so in sales they they use the term
04:08 hunters and farmers
04:10 yes yes exactly so this is this is more
04:13 like farming this is like maintenance
04:15 maintenance of existing customers
04:18 whereas if you want to hunt or you want
04:19 to find open up new customers
04:22 then you need to add on top of this some
04:24 additional agents in the west
04:25 specifically for hunting
04:28 absolutely very good inside there
04:31 and this could be a recommendation to
04:32 the management
04:37 okay we we
04:39 uh also you should wanted your uh
04:43 advice so we did look at this data in
04:46 two different visual representations
04:48 uh
04:50 a bar chart a side by side or a stacked
04:53 bar chart and
04:54 which do you think makes more sense
04:57 from a management perspective
04:60 i like this one that you're seeing right
05:02 now right the stacked one because it it
05:04 is simpler for me to visualize there's
05:06 not so many bars on the page
05:08 and it also gives me
05:11 the insight into how is it actually
05:13 broken down by region so you're you're
05:15 using fewer
05:17 uh objects in the chart but still
05:19 representing the same richness of
05:21 information so from a visual
05:23 representation perspective our goal is
05:25 always
05:26 to convey the most insight
05:29 with the with the least crowded
05:32 chart right so so i always
05:34 thought that look very simple but convey
05:37 lots and lots of different insights
05:40 uh by looking at a very simple
05:41 uncluttered kind of a presentation uh of
05:45 the data right so i like this one versus
05:47 the other one which had um i think
05:50 it does little bit cluttered no this
05:52 this does seem a little fluttered
05:55 exactly
05:58 yeah
05:59 yeah
06:01 in fact if you see the the total is also
06:03 conveyed with the same so you don't need
06:05 the separate line because
06:07 in this chart
06:08 the the the additive of all the four
06:11 slices is clearly visible whereas the
06:12 top of each bar i i can just see that
06:15 versus looking for a line right
06:18 so it's very uncluttering
06:21 right
06:23 yeah
06:25 yeah
06:26 so i think that is an interesting
06:29 learning you know when you're trying to
06:31 visualize the data it's important to
06:34 play around with a couple of formats and
06:36 try and select a format which is
06:38 least cluttered but conveys the most
06:40 information i think
06:43 that is that's a good learning from
06:46 this slide
06:48 absolutely and sometimes what you will
06:49 find and what i have found from my
06:51 experience is sometimes you get into
06:53 complex topics there is so much
06:55 information to be conveyed right and you
06:57 and you may sometimes only get
06:59 one slide
07:01 to actually convey because it's a top
07:02 management presentation we have only
07:04 five minutes you can only put in one
07:06 slide but you want to convey like i
07:09 don't know five different insights or
07:11 six different insights
07:13 that is the science and the art right
07:14 like how do you create a chart that is
07:17 uncluttered
07:18 it uses uh
07:20 very few structures right but yet at the
07:23 same time manages to convey
07:25 uh all of those insights in that one
07:27 slide
07:29 so that's a very important um
07:32 uh skill that uh people in the data and
07:35 analytics field need to need to pick up
07:37 it's a visual representation of
07:38 information and how do we excel in that
07:41 uh in that aspect
07:43 so shave on the slide one with the
07:45 percentages the stack graph is the
07:46 percentage on the right one
07:48 we can see basically that the north
07:50 region the percentage contribution has
07:52 been relatively stable
07:55 cluster whatever you said right yeah but
07:57 if you see that some things have
07:59 declared some things are increased
08:01 actually percentage-wise yeah i absolute
08:04 number i don't know i'm saying
08:04 percentage-wise so if you look
08:07 in some sense it looks like uh there has
08:09 been
08:10 some compensation between east and west
08:13 so some reduction has happened in the
08:15 east and it has got compensated by an
08:18 increase in this or something like that
08:20 yes
08:22 yes that is true i think what has
08:24 happened there is probably
08:26 some kind of
08:27 shutdown or labor issue or something in
08:30 the east
08:32 which may have contributed in december
08:34 to a to a much lower output
08:37 there
08:38 so you see only 18
08:40 so it went from 71
08:42 um
08:43 uh to 34 right from a quantity since
08:46 almost half
08:48 and uh
08:49 and in the west actually it went up so
08:52 probably you know maybe you know
08:55 some winning some additional customers
08:57 and the rest may have happened and then
08:59 some issues in the existing customer
09:01 base may have happened in the east which
09:03 results in
09:04 a reduction of
09:07 orders followers they may have
09:08 prioritized one customer in one month
09:10 then another customer in another month
09:12 does it happen
09:14 yes but also remember another thing
09:16 that's happened during this time is the
09:18 reduction of bs6
09:20 sorry bs4 uh rather the final
09:23 final leap of bs4 so there was a hump if
09:26 you remember of bs opponents that the
09:29 east based probably the customers were
09:31 the ones that were trying to
09:33 pump as many way possible
09:37 so if they need to sell by march they
09:39 need to probably need the components in
09:41 october
09:42 so they may have in a rush of orders
09:44 during that time that then
09:45 slowed down by december
09:49 okay
09:52 so this these are really interesting
09:53 right how these charts can really make
09:55 us
09:56 uh draw the equal and
09:59 what happened in the business and why
10:01 therefore the charts are showing the
10:03 numbers are showing so these are really
10:06 excellent
10:07 ways to prompt such discussions right
