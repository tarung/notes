00:00 So, G V,  
00:15 he saw that in rural people are spending a lot 
more on food. They are spending on intoxicants  
00:23 and they are spending on transport. So, 
maybe their savings are not very high.  
00:30 Likely, because their income also is low. 
So, how can we test out this hypothesis? I  
00:34 think there is this EMI column was there, 
remember? Yeah, EMI is there. Yeah, yeah.
00:39 Let us just look at EMIs.  
00:42 How many people had EMIs? It will be, EMI and only 
city will have it. Let us see whether it is city,  
00:50 we can also look at it by state, monthly 
expense on all EMIs. Let us remove.
00:55 Because those guys they go to moneylender. No, but 
I think the EMIs include moneylenders. Is it a,  
01:01 it does not? I think so. Let us look at, so rural 
only one person had EMI. That is what I am saying.
01:11 No, no, but there is a moneylender is also there  
01:14 knowing this. Has borrowings. 
EMI though. EMI means? They have  
01:20 has borrowings. Concept of EMI, what is that 
I mean? Moneylender I do not know what else.
01:23 Let us look at your right actually.  
01:28 Oh, that has borrowings was there in the other 
sheet. This EMI, where was the EMI? This will  
01:37 do by state, I think this might make sense. No, 
no, let us look at urban. Urban will be there.
01:42 Urban EMI 100 percent for homes, home loan 
they have taken. Where is filter? Clear.  
01:51 So where is EMI?  
02:13 Insurance. Insurance. It is not working.
02:35 This is it. Monthly expense of all EMIs. 
So, let us now remove 0 and blanks.  
02:45 So, what is it showing up? Only few people 
actually how many people are taking EMIs? 1,  
02:49 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 out of them 5 are. And what is 
also interesting GV to me what is striking  
02:56 is that there is only one person 
Uttarakhand who is taken in EMI.
03:01 Otherwise they are all from the southern 
states. See, not only organized in a way. So,  
03:10 the penetration of organized lending seems 
much higher in South India than it does in  
03:18 North India. There is more scope for doing lending 
in North India, organizing. Or East India maybe.
03:23 Or in East India. This is interesting. 
So, analysis by state also may give us  
03:30 some more interesting data. Those 
percentages are saying something  
03:34 what is it saying now? Let us see what 
they are saying. So, they are saying.
03:38 30 percent is what? 30 percent of their total 
expense is. Actually you know what this number  
03:45 is also getting changed. So, the numbers are 
not correct now. Which? This number is total.  
03:51 It is not subtotal, is it 
subtotal? It is subtotal.
03:58 So, total expense this you do not want 
me to use subtotal, you wanted me to use  
04:03 total. No, it has to be subtotal. So, of 
the money that these guys are spending,  
04:10 if you have an EMI, Oh right, yeah, yeah.  
04:14 Then the guys who have EMI's are totally spending 
about 1.02 lakhs, out of which 31,000 are.
04:23 You are right, you are right, you are right, 
I got confused. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Correct? It  
04:27 is correct. So, what are we saying? So, 
the people who have EMI's, 30 percent of  
04:32 their expenditure is going on EMI.
04:33 Correct. Good God. Look at that. And 
I suspect a lot of it is probably for  
04:38 buying a house. Maybe we should 
see. That we will not see here,  
04:42 that is again aspiration data. 
Oh, that is an aspirational data.
04:48 But it is not surprising, I mean people 
do spend a lot of money on EMI, those  
04:52 who have loans. Correct. Right. Those 
who have loans have very high loans.
04:55 Very high. But what is surprising G V E, while 
if that hypothesis was correct, here is a wage  
05:04 laborer family. This is your EMI? And their EMI. 
All matriculate. Look at that, all matriculate.  
05:13 All matriculate on a total expenditure of 23,000, 
6 and a half thousand is going on servicing loans.
05:23 It is potentially a debt trap.
05:26 Going here. No. Yeah. Yeah.  
05:35 Interesting. Interesting. See, 
this is giving a lot of insight.
05:39 Yes. And then so. So, we had this other 
hypothesis. Which is. So, since we are  
05:44 looking at statewide, we had said that 
meat consumption may vary by state. The  
05:51 vegetarian states. So, I would, 
let us look at meat consumption.
05:55 Is there a number? We had a number I think on 
meat. Meat consumption. Meat and fish, just got  
06:00 everything. This is meat, eggs and fish. 
So, let me just clear all the filters.
06:11 So, totally India's Indian 
family spent 4 percent on meat,  
06:16 meat, eggs and fish. So, let us take 
our hypothesis. Let us take the southern  
06:21 states. Take Kerala , Tamil Nadu. We 
will take all the southern states.
06:21 Andhra Pradesh. No, no, we did not want 
southern. We said eastern states, we said  
06:21 east coast states. Andhra Pradesh is okay. It is 
Odisha, Andhra Pradesh, West Bengal, Tamil Nadu.
06:21 Let us say. It will be high. It will be high. 
Take Kerala also, just for a heck of it.
06:47 Kerala. Odisha. Odisha, West 
Bengal. Kuducherry. Tripura.  
06:55 Tripura is not a sea coast. I do 
not think you should take Tripura.
06:57 You should not take. I am saying 
because they are near the sea, more  
07:04 consumption of fish. This 
is enough. Enough, enough.
07:04 Enough, enough. Tamil Nadu I missed.  
07:10 See 8 percent. 8 percent. Now, you go to  
07:14 select Rajasthan, landlocked. Of 
course, Gujarat is not landlocked.
07:22 But Gujarat, I think northeastern 
states. Haryana also I think. Haryana.
07:35 Haryana, Punjab. Take the stick. 
Punjab. Landlocked. Punjab. Rajasthan.
07:37 Punjab and Rajasthan. Let us look at this. 
So, this is the India's northwestern border.  
07:45 Something like that. South east versus 
west. South east versus north west.
07:50 Vegetarian is a West Indian phenomenon. 
Look at this. 1 percent. What is this?  
07:57 Vegetarianism is a West Indian phenomenon.
07:59 Correct. Not an East Indian phenomenon. North 
also, let us do that a little bit more. Let  
08:06 us look at what happens if I pick, let us 
say Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh. Bihar.
08:12 Let us pick Bihar. Bihar will also be 
vegetarian. Possible, possible. Madhya Pradesh.  
08:20 Gangetic plains we will pick.
08:22 Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand. That is enough. 
Let us see. 4 percent. So, they are about  
08:28 average. They are about average. It is a north 
western border that is strongly vegetarian.
08:35 And the east coast is non-vegetarian. 
Coastal. Coastal. Coastal. Except for  
08:39 Gujarat. Let us just take Gujarat. Gujarat is 
an anomaly I think. Gujarat also I think GV the  
08:48 coast is such that it is probably, 
it is too salty and marshy and.
08:52 You do not get fish up. Maybe, maybe. I do 
not know. Just check. We do not know in our  
08:59 sight. I do not know what they do.
09:02 But it looks like they are 
vegetarian. Gujarat is 0 percent on.  
09:07 They probably do not give information. If you 
ask them to eat meat, they will probably say no.
09:12 Even though they may be eating meat. I do not  
09:14 know. Probably. This is 0 
percent. It is unlikely 0.
09:21 Of course, the sample. Sample. It could 
be because of sampling. If we say Haryana,  
09:26 Haryana is 1 percent. See, 
actually, let us see what.
09:33 Goa will be. Goa is probably high. 
8 percent. Not surprised. Not at  
09:38 all. Even actually take Tirupurra 
or something. Let us take Punjab.
09:42 Punjab actually I think. It is a 
vegetarian state actually. Is it? Yeah,  
09:46 it is. You get all these pictures of. 
That is true. It is only 2 percent.
09:50 They drink a lot of milk and all, 
but they are vegetarian. Actually,  
09:52 you get all these pictures of the. Correct. 
Consumed of non-vegetarian, chicken or something.
09:56 No, it is not true. Not true. Interesting. Very  
09:59 interesting. Tirupurra we said. Not 
to have enough data may not be there.
10:03 15 percent. But of course, it is a 
hard to. Now, one day. Just one sample.  
10:09 But 15 percent. No, no, northeast of course.
10:12 Northeast I think in general people. Generally. 
This is interesting. Interesting. So, I mean,  
10:19 I think what is illustrated here is that 
you can do so much analysis. I think that is  
10:24 more important. You can do so much analysis by 
just putting down the subtotal and percentage.
10:31 And you can analyze on multiple axis. And then 
you do filter. You can do by. And then done, done,  
10:35 done. And then you just keep seeing the percentage 
and you get some information. Without too much  
10:40 effort. And you can copy that information 
down somewhere on the sheet and make graph.
10:42 Make a graph. Without having to do some 
Excel thing. Correct. Complicated Excel  
10:48 thing. Correct. That is the useful thing I think 
here. And you can do this on multiple axis.
10:54 You can do space, you can do 
state, you can do education,  
10:57 you can do age. And you do not have 
to redo the effort every time. It is  
11:02 just once you have got this entire 
machinery set up, it is for free.
11:05 Free. It is for free. Nice. So, what would 
be nice, Milan, is to see, I want to see some  
11:15 income correlates. Or understand consumption, how 
it goes with income, but we do not have income.  
11:21 We have income in the other sheet, but then 
that does not give us the expense breakdown.
11:28 So, that gives us income, but not the expense. 
It is not the same household. It is not the  
11:32 same household. So, what do we do? Can we 
do, so without income, but I still want,  
11:36 so let us take a surrogate for income. Is there 
a proxy for income? Education, one hypothesis  
11:43 that we can make is that. It is not, I mean 
there is statistical evidence that if there is.
11:47 People are more educated than 
they are. More educated family,  
11:50 there will be more income. I think 
that is well established. Let us check  
11:53 that out. What are we checking? 
What we can do is we can say.
11:56 We take those houses which have 
more graduates. Graduates. More  
11:58 graduates. Take those households which have more 
graduates and see whether they are spending more.
11:59 All graduates or graduate majority.  
12:09 Take like that. There are not too many. No, 
that is okay. And we can see that the average  
12:18 for these guys. So, if I just say average 
expense and average if you remember was 101  
12:27 is 17000. On an average households that have 
graduates are spending 17000 rupees a month.
12:39 Same thing if I just say household of. 
Illiterates. Illiterates and some illiterate.  
12:52 That is it. You can see that. 
Now, let us look at matriculate.
13:03 All matriculate and matriculate 
dominated. Dominated  
13:15 also. Matriculate. Matriculate 
minority. 14.3 percent.  
13:21 14.3 k. So, it is less than 17 k. But it is 
probably, so if I look at just literates and  
13:31 literates I am assuming means that they know how 
to read and write, but they have not passed 10th.
13:44 If I just look at that, it is about 11 k.  
13:48 So, it is increasing. It is kind of a. Fair 
to assume that as. Assume that graduation.
13:51 As education increases. Education increases,  
13:53 the expenditure. Household expenses increase. 
Therefore, also must be income of this degree.
13:57 Correct. That is our hypothesis. Hypothesis. 
So, can I now see what percentage. So,  
14:04 now I will go back to getting total instead of 
average. Now, you want to do these percentages.  
14:11 But I want to do these percentages for 
graduate, the majority graduate households.  
14:18 Where are they spending their 
money on? Let us do that.
14:22 I guess they will be spending the money on 
education. This is my guess. If they are graduate  
14:27 people, they will be spending a lot of money on 
education and maybe medical expense. Possible.
14:32 So, let us see. Or if they are house then EMI. So, 
I have picked, I will tell you what I have picked.  
14:36 I have picked all graduates, graduate majority and 
graduate minority. Wherever they are graduates.
14:42 House also with graduates. House also with 
graduates. Let us see the percentages for this.  
14:47 And then you wanted what? You wanted education. 
Education. What is education? How much they are  
14:53 spending on education? But first let us see 
the total expenditure is 35 percent only.
14:60 Not that. Yes. On food. On food. So, it 
is come down. So, they are spending on  
15:06 other things. They are spending on other things. 
That is the first. Now let us look at education.
15:10 How about intoxicants? We will see. No,  
15:16 we can do that actually 
because that is the next thing.
15:19 Maybe they are getting drunk.  
15:21 I do not think so. Maybe it is low. My 
guess is low. Let us see. Let us see.  
15:34 2 percent. How much was it? 
It was 4 percent for average.
15:40 Average was 4. Average was, 
no average for rural was 4,  
15:43 average for urban was 2. So, it is like an urban.
15:45 It is like normal. Normal urban. Let 
us look at education. Let us look at  
15:51 education. Let me search for. Hey, by the way, 
this cosmetics is spending money on toiletries.
15:59 Look at that. 4 percent  
16:04 on toiletries. Luxury items. Is not it? Let 
us just do that. So, since we are at it,  
16:13 where was that education? 
Let us remove this and see.
16:18 Matriculates. Matriculates. Anywhere 
where there is a matriculate.  
16:30 This is also spending. 5 
percent. They are also spending.
16:34 Let us just say, let us look at all.  
16:37 Everybody is spending 5 percent. So, 
not a luxury item. Soap, I think maybe.
16:43 Soap maybe. So, let us go back to graduates. 
And we want to see education. Education.  
17:05 11 percent. And let me just do this. So, 
let us, average expense is 5 percent.
17:15 See, first of all, rural urban. Just 
do rural urban. Rural urban. See,  
17:20 I think that urban, rural people will go to 
garbage school. Maybe 0 spending. 4 percent.
17:28 Urban is probably 5 percent. Not much difference.  
17:33 But the difference is coming because of, 
so it is rural urban is not so much. It is,  
17:38 are the people at home educated? People who 
are educated seem to spend more on education.
17:45 And then their children will get 
educated. They will be educated. So,  
17:48 they will be self-perpetured.  
17:51 Eighth problem. Interesting. It is the people 
who are not educated are not spending on.
17:55 Try to look at the metricolate. Try to 
look at the illiterate. What is illiterate?  
18:05 This also I look. This is probably the  
18:11 3 percent. 11 versus 3. Now, let 
us look at some metricolates.
18:16 Metricolate may also be spending actually.  
18:21 Metricolates actually. Because they 
will want to become graduates. 4  
18:28 percent. That is actually the bulk 
of the, I think the, 25 out of  
18:40 100 records are matriculates.
18:44 That is the bulk of India. Let us look at 
health. There is another thing is medicine.  
18:48 Health. Yes. What was the thing? 
What was the… Again, same thing.
18:53 I think the rural people, something has 
happened. We can go here and see. What was it?  
19:05 Medical. Just say school college 
fees. There is nothing like that.
19:09 Just see that is a lot. There is a thing called 
school college fees. Just go to education. See  
19:14 school college fees and private tuition fees. 
Just look at those two. Let us look at that.  
19:22 I do not think any rural person will be 
spending money on school college fees.
19:26 Not that many at least, but definitely 
tuition fees may be very low.  
19:31 So, 2 percent on an average. No, 
I have to remove this filter.
19:39 On an average it is 3 percent.  
19:47 Rural is 3 percent. What is 
it? Everybody goes to private  
19:51 school. Urban is also 3 percent. Okay. 
Tuition? So, tuition is the next one.
20:00 So, urban is 1 percent. Rural is 0 percent. 
So, urban is spending something on it.  
20:09 So, tuition is much more of an urban. 
Graduates. Take graduates there.
20:20 It is an urban phenomenon.  
20:27 3 percent. Graduates are spending more on  
20:32 it. But that, my suspicion is 
matriculates will be spending more.
20:36 6 percent. Because parents can teach. No,  
20:43 at home matriculate method that may not be 
possible. Correct. This is probably what it is.  
20:50 Wow. This is good insight. Yeah. So, 
when families are largely matriculate,  
20:56 they have the ambition to educate the children, 
but they may not be able to guide the children.
21:01 Therefore, they go to private tuition.  
21:05 Wow. But again, here you see only 
few, it is dominated by a few numbers.
21:10 Actually, this one family is spending a lot. 
Organized farmer family is spending a lot.  
21:17 It is queuing the number. Maybe. Maybe. It is 
queuing the number. It is queuing the number.  
21:23 But anyway, your hypothesis, I mean, if you 
will have larger sample, you will get no.
21:26 Correct. It is very likely actually what you 
are saying. Health, you had this other thing.
21:28 Health. But is there a, she thinks. I think 
this. Medicines. Medicines. Yeah, health.  
21:40 This again, I expect that urban.
21:41 Urban will be. More, I think. 
That is all there are doctors. 0  
21:55 percent on health. No, health supplements. 
This is health supplements. Health.
22:05 5 percent. 3 percent  
22:17 on health. No, metric, let us spend more 
actually. And urban is also 3 percent. Same it is.  
22:27 India as a whole spends 3 percent on health.
22:31 Not much difference. Not much difference. 
Like if you want to see by education,  
22:35 if that makes a difference. 
Graduate households is 4 percent.
22:42 4 percent. Look at largely illiterate or less 
educated. Let us not say illiterate because  
23:01 it is not. 3 percent.
23:03 It is average. So, graduates are 
spending a bit more. Little bit more.  
23:06 Alright. I think we got sense. I think this 
data is very good. It gives us a lot of insight.  
23:15 There are some things we can do with aspirational 
data set, but I think we will take it up later.  
23:18 Yes. Because we I want to understand the 
number of people who will buy two wheelers.
23:26 In fact, I am very particular to understand 
not only those people will buy two wheelers,  
23:30 but those people will take loans for 
buying two wheelers. I want to know  
23:33 that. That should be our journey over 
the next few weeks. Let us find out.
