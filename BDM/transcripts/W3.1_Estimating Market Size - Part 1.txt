00:00 So, Jeevi,  
00:15 you were saying that the thing that you 
are most interested in is to find out  
00:23 the size of the market for loans to buy two 
wheelers. You have to start with two wheelers  
00:31 first, then loans. First two wheelers. I want 
to understand how many people will buy two   wheelers. Then we will find out how many of those 
people will buy it loans. We will take loans.
00:39 We will take loan to buy. So, new two 
wheelers, not. New two wheelers. So,  
00:45 who is going to buy new two 
wheelers? How do you find out? So,   there is a thing problem which is 
called addressable market sizing.
00:52 So, you want to find out 
what is addressable market,   how to size it. So, you have to ask some 
questions, I guess. The way it goes is  
01:00 you will have to ask some questions and then 
try and. First we will make some assumptions,   then you have to get data actually. 
If you have data, then you can do.
01:07 We have some data, I think. 
Some data. You do not have data,   then you go into a survey and get 
the data. That is how it works.   So, to start with, where do you start? 
You have to start with the population.
01:17 So, let us say that you have population. 
Population of India or you take some subset?   Depends on whether you are selling in all India 
or you are making a scooter only for regional  
01:24 knowledge. You could say I am making a scooter 
only for Tamil Nadu. It makes a difference because   if you say I am only interested in selling scooter 
for Tamil Nadu, you will also advertise in the  
01:33 local channels in Tamil Nadu, Tamil channels. 
No, no, I was thinking slightly differently. We will look at India. Only 18 to 50, 60 year 
olds will probably drive scooters is what I  
01:43 was thinking. Do we? People are used. I have 
seen somewhat older people who are used to  
01:50 driving only scooter will drive scooter 
also. So, 18 plus, 18 plus will drive. Of course, you need to have driving license. 
Correct. So, we will see. I think we need,  
01:59 so one corroborating piece 
of information is how many   people have driving license. You do not have 
driving license, they cannot have scooter. Of course, there are these categories 
called mopeds. We will ignore that.  
02:07 Moped categories like cycle, right? You do not 
need license. Correct. We will ignore that. We are talking about scooters for which 
you need a two-wheel driving license. So,  
02:17 one piece of information we could 
get is by asking RT office or. So,  
02:23 I will just write down. Number of 
two-wheeler licenses that are there. Two-wheeler. More than that because we are 
interested in finding out two-wheeler licenses  
02:33 that have been issued, already issued. And then. 
And you can find out how many are being issued  
02:40 new, new every year or every month. Let me just. 
So, statistics on two-wheeler license issues  
02:48 and which region there is to 
be more two-wheeler license. Those are the regions where two-wheeler license 
is bought. Correct. That is a fair point. So,  
02:53 this is one piece of information. I 
do not know where we will get it from. At least our data does not have that. No. But I   guess this you get by talking 
to RT office. Yeah, I guess.
03:01 RT offices. It is a government record anyway. 
This is not secret information or anything.  
03:08 No. So, here what do you want? We want to 
know its breakup. New two-wheeler licenses.
03:20 So, what should I do? This is, we have done some.  
03:35 Number of new two-wheeler licenses. Being issued. 
And then we want. So, it is easier to see.
03:42 I have increased it. 140. 140. Breakup of.
03:49 By. Breakup by. Geography and other things. State.
03:54 State. Yeah. State. Income 
group. Income group, how will,  
03:60 RTO will not have that information. 
State will be there. State is good. State is good to start with. State. Region of 
right. This is one piece of information. We  
04:12 went off sidetracked I think. The main thing 
basically is you start with some population. Let us say we have a population of 100. Start with 
that. 100 percent. So, start with population 100.
04:22 Total population 100. Total number of people 
100. Of these, you want to find out who will  
04:32 buy two-wheelers. So, where do you start? I 
would say you should start with people who   are travelling. Why do you have two-wheelers? You 
have to travel because you want to travel. Just  
04:40 like if you say how many people are thirsty, 
you will look for Coca Cola if you want to sell. You look at how many people are 
thirsty, how many will drink water,  
04:47 like that you go. Like that you have to start with 
something, you are starting with travelling. So,   what do you mean by that? People who spend 
money on travelling. How many people spend  
04:55 money on travelling? And then they can spend 
money on travelling for many reasons. One is   that they spend money on travelling 
because they have to go to office.
05:02 Such people, you know like gig 
worker, if you have a swiggy driver,   you need to have a two-wheeler. It is necessary 
for your job. So, person who travels to office,  
05:11 who do not mind spending money on it because 
it is very productive to have a two-wheeler.  
05:17 And then there are people who will buy it for 
leisure, travelling on weekends only for leisure.
05:23 So, that is another. Now, of those 
people who travel, there are many modes,   ways of going. You can go by train, bus and all 
that you can do that. So, the public transport.  
05:34 So, how many of these, of these, how 
many people travel by public transport?  
05:42 How many people travel by, what is the 
trend of public transport travellers?  
05:53 By public transport,   is that percentage increasing, decreasing? That 
is another thing you have to understand. Like  
06:00 for example, in the US, the public 
transport percentage has decreased. Even more people travel by their own vehicles. 
So, that shows that vehicle sales have increased.  
06:09 Whereas in India, it might be increasing. For 
example, in the city of Chennai, metro has come.
06:14 Yes. More people prefer to metro. Yes. So, maybe 
they will even give up their two-wheelers. Yes. We  
06:20 do not know. I do not know if they will 
give up, but certainly daily commute. And they will not do it for office. Yes. 
They will do it for leisure. Yes. Then  
06:28 that is another thing. And therefore, the 
kind of vehicle they buy may be different. May be different, may be different. Yes, yes,   if it is leisure, it might be different. It 
may not be two-wheeler, may be car. Correct.  
06:36 What percentage travel by public transport? 
So, of the, balance are basically  
06:41 to transport, some of them will travel by 
car. So, how many of these, how many by car?  
06:58 By four-wheeler, you say.
07:03 If they have four-wheeler, they are 
not going to buy. An assumption is   that they are not going to buy. May not. 
There will still be some percentage of  
07:09 them buy two-wheelers. Because two-wheelers 
generally do better in traffic than cars. So, they may buy. Car person 
might buy a two-wheeler also.  
07:17 Correct. More likely he will have 
a two-wheeler than he buys a car. Yes. That is the order in which it goes. 
Correct. But anyway, how many already own a car,  
07:23 then you can say the rest basically are looking 
to buy two-wheeler or they have a two-wheeler.   How many of them have two-wheelers already? 
Does not mean that they will not buy one,  
07:37 but the probability is lower. So, 
now if you subtracted all this,  
07:43 then what is left basically is the people who 
are interested probably in buying two-wheeler.  
07:56 Possible, but they should have the income. They will have to check the income now.  
08:06 Provided they can afford it. Can 
they afford it? We have to check.  
08:13 Affordability check means that do they have 
enough income? Do they have enough savings?  
08:39 If they do not have the savings, 
but they still have an income,   they can borrow. This is what 
we are interested in finally.
08:46 Have the ability to borrow. Ability 
means income. In this case, it is income.  
08:58 They have the ability to repay. Then they can 
borrow. So, that is showing affordability.  
09:07 So, if you look at the affordable, 
you do the intersection of this,   you will get the possibly the number of people 
who may be interested in buying two-wheeler.
09:13 But even if these people are 
interested in buying two-wheeler,   they might decide to buy, again, it falls back 
also to the affordable question. They may decide  
09:25 if it is the borderline affordability 
to buy a second hand, not a new one.  
09:32 So, you have to know the breakup of 
the market by first hand and second   hand. There is Spinny, the 
Red which sells second hand.
09:39 Clearly, there is a market for second hand.  
09:48 So, hopefully the balance percentage 
is, this is buying new. Balance is now.  
10:04 So, this will be the way of calculating, one way 
of calculating addressable market. Of course,   you will cross check this 
against many other things.
10:11 What will you check? You have to cross check it. 
We already set driving license. If your number  
10:16 comes out to much higher than the rate at which 
driving license are being issued or something   is wrong, something is seriously wrong. It has 
to correlate with the past trend in two-wheeler  
10:26 sales. Suddenly, you are saying that 40% increase 
in two-wheeler sales is going to happen, whereas  
10:31 historically for the last 20 years, two-wheeler 
sales has only happened at 10% increase annually.
10:37 Something is wrong. Let me add 
that here. So, what did we say?  
10:47 Check. You know these are the checks. Past trends 
in two-wheeler sales. You have to check that.
10:59 Then you have to check, so it cannot be way out 
of that. Then you have to check, you have to  
11:10 check with your dealers, distributors and all. 
They will know. You are doing some statistics,  
11:16 number crunching, excel, but you have to have feet 
on the ground. So, feet on ground is talking to  
11:22 your dealers and distributors, dealer distributor 
feedback. They can tell you, I mean, how many  
11:28 more are they going to push? If they say that I 
have pushed last year, I pushed 30,000 scooters.
11:34 Next year, I think I can push 40,000 scooters. 
Then you get some sense. Then you know,  
11:40 you get a sense like that. So, that is 
another. So, all these things you have to   do. If you do all this, then hopefully you get, 
you get some percentage, you get some number.
11:49 So, what? You get right, like 
you got 100 here. So, of this,   let us try some numbers. Of course, you have to 
validate by actually looking at the real sheets.
11:58 Then 80%, will it travel? 80%. We 
saw some data earlier. I think so.  
12:07 Of which majority will travel for work, I think 
70 maybe travel for work, 10 only for leisure.  
12:15 Then of this 80%, what percentage will travel by 
public transport? Half, 50, 60%. I do not know.
12:28 I really do not know. Most of 
the, 2,000,000 per year, I think.  
12:37 I think so. Maybe like 20, 30%. 
We will find out if we have data.
12:43 So. But, so I should say 70% is public 
transport. So, 70% of 70%, which is like 49.
12:50 70 of 80, you can take both. 70 of 80. So,   70 of 80 is 56. 56. But, 70 of 
80 is 50. So, 70 of 80 is 50.
12:57 So, 70 of 80 is 50. So, 70 of 80 is 50. So, 
70 of 80 is 50. The reason why that we should   split that between leisure and this thing is 
that leisure guys might buy a bigger vehicle,  
13:03 family vehicle and all that. More 
car, car type than scooter type. How many already own a car? Very small 
percentage own car, 10%. 5. 5%. 5%.  
13:20 This you said 30, no? 25. How many 
already own? Out of 56, 30 you can take.
13:26 30 million already. 20, 80. 20, 80 you can take.  
13:33 Is that all guesses? No? Yeah. We will validate. 
We will have to check. We will have to check. Yes, people who may be interested in buying 
two wheeler is the rest. Sir, this is 23.  
13:40 23. Assuming that car. Out of 100 people, 23 
people are interested in buying two wheeler.
13:46 That is the addressable market. Not yet fully 
done because you have to cross lane. Check.  
13:52 Because if you see 23 out of 
28, it is actually showing 100%   decrease. It is very unlikely. It 
is not going to happen next year.
13:59 Even though 23 may be buying,   they will take some time to buy. It is 
based on affordability or something.  
14:05 So, of these, what percentage have enough savings 
to buy a two wheeler? I really do not know. That way too. I think many will be able 
to borrow. Let us say 5. Maybe we can say  
14:16 5. 5. 5 may have savings, another 5 may be 
willing to borrow. Say this is 10 out of 23.  
14:26 So, maybe 10 out of 100 people. 10% of 
the population is buying a two wheeler.
14:33 So, lot, 140 crores and 14 
crores are two wheelers.   Unlikely. Unlikely. Very unlikely. We 
do not have that many two wheelers. Sir,  
14:44 maybe some of our assumptions are wrong. 
You should take it out 5 years maybe. Maybe some of our assumptions are wrong. So, 14 
crores, but not actually, it will need 10 years.  
14:57 5 years. 5 years. There is a some of our 
assumptions could be wrong and of course, you  
15:03 know, we have just taken guesses, you know. But 
it is a way, I mean, we are saying how to do it.
15:09 Of these, how many will buy second hand?   Half. Is it? I do not think. No. Lot 
of people buy second hand two wheelers.
15:18 3 out of, 3 out of 10. Sir. 7 will buy new.  
15:31 So, 7 out of 100 people   will buy a new two wheeler. According 
to our numbers. According to our.
15:38 I think it is too optimistic, but yeah. This 
is the way to calculate addressable market.  
15:44 Good. You divide this by 
5, maybe you get per year. Maybe. Maybe they buy it over 5 years. Which is 
realistic. 1.4 percent of India's population,  
15:55 140 crore, 1.4 is 1 and a half 
into 4, 5 crore, 2 wheelers.
16:02 I think the market for 2 wheelers is a few 
crores of 2 wheelers being sold every year.
16:10 So, 1.4 into 1.4 is like. 2 and a half. 2.5 
crores. 2 and 2.5 crores. The ballpark, maybe  
16:21 up by 100 percent, 50 percent something, but it is 
there, somewhere there. We know a way, I mean this  
16:26 is a way to calculate. So, this is a addressable 
market calculation. Now, we can see that any   such calculation that we do of addressable 
market requires phenomenal amount of data.
16:37 So, you need data for. So, some of this data I 
think we already had. We already had, we already   looked at also. We already looked at. How many 
travel for work and we tried to look at all that.
16:47 Work, I do not know if we had, but at 
least we know how many travel. We did   not ask that question. No, no, but it is there. 
We can say people who spend money on travel.  
16:57 Did they say how, whether they travel for work 
or not? No, that they did. Hey, another thing,   another factor, go back to that sheet. Another 
factor is how far are they travelling from work?  
17:11 Yes, because if I am travelling 100 kilometres 
a day, then I would not take a 2 wheeler.
17:16 No way they will go by 2 wheeler. 
They will take public transport.  
17:22 How far do people travel? Where should I put that?   How far, yeah, of which, of which how many 
percentage travel less than 20 kilometre  
17:36 to work or something. So, that is the main factor. 
So, I said how far are you travelling? How far   do you want to work? So, how far is the work 
going? How far is the work going? 50 or something. 50. 50 is also too much. 50 is too much.  
17:44 30 kilometre. 30 kilometre. 
30 kilometre. 30 kilometre. You know how long it takes? 20  
17:53 kilometre. 20 kilometre for work. Daily. Daily. 
I will say just a daily. Yeah, those are the  
18:10 guys. Those are the guys who are likely to buy. 
So, let us see if we have some of this data. They have given, we know how 
many minutes they travel. They,  
18:20 we do not know how much distance they travel. 
But that also we can interpret. No, actually,  
18:27 if somebody is travelling 30 to 60 minutes, he 
is probably not going to take a two wheeler.
18:33 Okay. Yeah. Would you, would you say so? Maybe.  
18:39 Maybe. How many people are 
30 to 60 minutes? Let us see. Everybody is 30 to 60 minutes, we 
have nothing. No interpretation.  
18:51 You are going to filter? Yeah. Okay.  
19:01 Let us do this. Well, so quite a few. 
How many is that? What is the count?  
19:12 48 out of 100 travel less than 30 minutes.
19:18 Nice. Yeah. Okay, so we will change 
our formula instead of saying  
19:24 40 kilometres, say travel less than 30 minutes. 
It is a good proxy. It is a good proxy.  
19:38 So, we said 48, no? 40 percent 
of? 48 of 100. Of the, okay.
19:48 So, we can also see how many people 
spend money on transport, no?  
19:53 Or either I have actually this, if I 
just include this. So, this is now,  
20:04 so out of 62, 48 travel less than 30, 62 people 
we know for a fact travel. Travel, it is not 80,  
20:13 it is 62. No, no, that is because 38 people 
do not, have not replied to the survey.
20:18 Oh, so all are not travelling. Of the people 
who responded, everybody seems to be travelling.  
20:24 Okay. No, actually, okay. How many? 
Depends on how the question is framed.
20:29 Yeah, yeah. So, let us see how many people travel 
less than 50 minutes. This is the same as 0. 3.  
20:35 So, 3 out of 62. 3 out of 62 means how 
much? 95 percent of people are travelling. 95 percent, so let us go change our. 95, it is 
95, at least from the survey. Correct. My, okay.  
20:49 So, 3 out of 62 is equal to 0.7, no, we said 
what 90 percent of these travel for work,  
21:01 no? Yeah, 90 percent. Yes, again, yeah. And then,  
21:09 correct, of which, of this 95, how many 
travel? Half of them are travelling  
21:19 by public transport for less than 30 minutes. No, no, no, no, no, less than 30 
minutes. Half of them. So, 48 out of 62,  
21:27 48 out of 62, no? So, 45 out of 62. Are 
travelling less than 30 minutes. Yeah.
21:34 So, I think, so here is how I calculated. 70 
percent. This is, this is this, this is, this is,  
21:45 it was in the aspirational India dataset. 
So, out of that 42, we can assume that less  
21:52 than 15 percent basically do not travel. So, 
it is 15th of 30 is what we should look at. Yes. 15 to 30 is 45. 42, 45 out of 62 
travel in a distance range that a two  
22:05 wheeler can support. Which is 70, sorry, 
45 and 62 is 6 times 42, 70 percent.
22:11 We will do that, no? So, this is equal to 95 into 
45 by about 69 percent. 79 people. Yeah, out of  
22:29 6. It is a lot. Yeah. Of which, of what 
percentage travel by public transport? So, this.
22:42 That is the remaining balance. No, no, no. We 
do not know. We do not know. We do not know. So,  
22:49 this data is there in that consumption patterns 
survey. If you go to consumption patterns,  
22:54 there is I think,  
23:02 bus, there is a bus thing. Oh, how much is spent on buses? Yeah. They do not 
know if they are spending it daily or. That is  
23:12 true. We do not know whether they are going for 
leisure on buses. But it is a way of checking. Yeah. So, if you see, actually 
hold on, let me remove all filters.  
23:37 So, about 39 people at Alibabas have 
spent some money on bus. Out of a total of  
23:48 61 people who responded to the survey. So, 
39 and 61 have spent some money on bus.  
23:55 We can assume that if somebody is travelling every 
day by bus, he is spending at least 200 rupees.
24:02 Yeah. So, I will remove everybody 
who is spending less than.  
24:11 Yeah, can do that. Yeah, some of them are 
going by factory bus and all, we do not know. Maybe. All that you have to look. But still. It is 
still 19 people probably travel by bus. Out of 61.  
24:24 Out of 61. So, 30 percent. 30 percent. Let 
us take that 30 percent for return put.
24:31 I mean, we have to do a more 
scientific survey. We could be wrong.   This has to be done scientifically. 
30 percent travel, travel by bus.  
24:48 So, you can do that 30 percent of 69 you can take. 
So, this I will put 30 percent here and this is.
24:56 Of 69 only. What did I do? That is 
not, you are making a number for  
25:09 me. So, 21 people out of 69 travel 
by. Bus. Bus. So, the remaining means.
25:19 So, remaining is 69 minus. 48 are 
remaining. Of that 5 own a car.  
25:28 28 already have 200. So, now you 
have to subtract from 48, 5 and 28.
25:41 125. Of course, hold on, hold on. So, this 
data also we have. How many own a car?  
25:47 Yes. We have aspirational 
data set. So, this is the car.
25:54 Yeah.  
26:09 It is small I think. So, one. It tells you 
which car also. So, it is I do not know. 6  
26:39 out of, 6 out of, hold on, I 
should remove also it has no. Yes, 99 is there. 62, out 
of 62, 6. So, 10 percent.   So, 5 is not correct, 10 it is. So, 10 percent 
of 48, it is 5. Wow, something man. Now,  
26:54 we can also, this can also tell 
us how many own a two wheeler.
26:60 Already own a two wheeler. Yeah. So, out of 
62, let us say how many own a two wheeler?  
27:20 46 out of 62 already own a two wheeler. Is that true? Looks like. I really do not think 
that that many people have two wheelers. So,  
27:31 this is out of this. You have nothing left. For this. You do negative. 
No, no, I do not think so.  
27:40 35. So, you took 46 percent. No, I took 
46 out of 62 already own a two wheeler.
27:48 Oh, that percentage. That percentage I took.  
27:54 So, 36. So, 36 out of 48 already own a 
two wheeler. Now, you are left with 7.
28:02 7 100 want to buy two   wheeler. May. May want to buy. Provide the 
kind of food. Provide the kind of food.  
28:09 And that also split into some number of. Correct.   So, yeah, this seems reasonable. It looks like a 
number. Now, this data of course, we do not have  
28:19 in very good because we know people have savings, 
but we do not know how much savings they have.
28:25 We do not have that. That number we do not have. 
So, now, I do not know whether we can. And we  
28:31 know how many people are borrowing already. So, 
that is another thing. Yeah, but again ability,   you know, how much whether they have 
income to support an EMI, we do not know.  
28:40 So, how do we get this data? This data is cannot 
be answered with the two data sets that we have.  
28:46 See, the way to do it is to run a survey. I think in all of these things after 
you have got this kind of level of,  
28:51 I think quite a lot of clarity you have got. At 
this point in time, one should just do a custom   survey. You should run it with distributed dealers 
or you go directly with customers and do it.  
29:01 So, you have to generate a custom survey 
asking very specific questions. Like,  
29:07 what is your income? Are you intending to buy 
a two wheeler? If so, are you going to buy a  
29:13 new one? Are you going to buy second hand

considering a two wheeler purchase?   Daily commute, convenience, portability.

are you planning to finance it with a loan?

loan? Can afford to pay in cash, prefer not to

us. This is really, really good. How much time  
34:17 it says? Wonderful. I think we should encourage
