00:00 [Music]
00:20 so do you want to lead into the case uh
00:24 sure
00:25 so
00:25 so uh you know let me start sharing my
00:29 screen uh and while i do that
00:32 so judy do you want to give us an
00:35 overview of what we are going to learn
00:36 in the next two weeks
00:39 we are going to look at a number of
00:40 issues that come up in manufacturing
00:42 industry specifically
00:45 i think she will speak with his
00:46 experience about
00:48 first of all i mean
00:50 this is a data science course so
00:52 question about where the data comes from
00:54 in a manufacturing industry is it really
00:56 digital
00:57 how do we convert all the existing
00:58 physical records that are there in
00:60 manufacturing industry to digital those
01:01 kind of issues
01:03 we have to look at it so that will come
01:04 certainly we will try to introduce some
01:06 of that but we want to see the digital
01:08 data that is available in manufacturing
01:09 industries and use it to
01:11 do some analysis of sales
01:13 and revenue similar to what we did in
01:15 the
01:16 fab mart the e-commerce case that we did
01:18 already already
01:20 but the difference from that case
01:21 leading into this case is that where
01:23 these products are not
01:25 stocked and sold like e-commerce but
01:27 they're actually manufactured
01:28 so don't look at the factory aspects how
01:30 we do
01:31 production planning
01:33 and analysis of the
01:35 and scheduling of the production
01:38 and the analysis of that
01:39 and uh you know
01:41 materials that go into production
01:43 basically they have costs and so on so
01:44 we look at the bill of materials
01:46 and then profitability analysis of
01:48 different parts
01:50 and uh work back from there to
01:51 understand
01:53 the materials how do you plan
01:55 requirement of materials what kind of
01:56 materials are required first of all to
01:58 do this production
01:59 what kind of human resources are
02:00 required to do this production so some
02:02 kind of
02:04 requirement analysis that we will be
02:05 doing for these
02:07 raw materials and human resources
02:08 and we saw a little bit of some of this
02:10 in the first four weeks
02:12 how material and
02:14 material and
02:15 people
02:16 people resources and material resources
02:18 how important they are in the costing
02:20 and in planning and all that so we're
02:22 going to get into it in more detail in
02:24 this case
02:26 and of course as we go along doing it
02:28 all of this we'll be doing this through
02:29 spreadsheets so
02:30 you'll learn a little bit more about
02:31 spreadsheets and how to use spreadsheets
02:33 to rule this kind of analysis so with
02:34 that context uh maybe uh
02:38 we can start
02:39 talking about the case that we have
02:41 today the case that we have today is
02:43 about a company called ace gears
02:46 and ace gears is what is called in the
02:49 automotive industry as a tier one
02:51 supplier
02:53 uh the people that make the cars
02:56 actually that make and sell the cars in
02:58 the automotive industry are called oems
03:01 uh and these would then be people like
03:04 that
03:05 equipment manufacturer right
03:07 original equipment manufacturer
03:09 and there's companies like
03:12 hyundai or general motors or ford
03:15 uh
03:16 companies like that uh but there are a
03:19 bunch of companies as ship was
03:21 mentioning that actually make the sub
03:23 assemblies and uh
03:26 uh a skiers is one of the one one such
03:30 company and so in that context it's
03:32 called
03:33 a tier one
03:34 so ship why don't you tell us a little
03:36 bit about this company you know what
03:37 what does this company do uh what are uh
03:40 some of the challenges that a company
03:42 like this faces
03:44 uh that we can use data to analyze
03:48 absolutely um so so as you as just as
03:53 melin just mentioned um the ace years is
03:56 actually
03:58 is actually manufacturing
03:60 gear assemblies so so
04:02 you know basically when you think of the
04:04 concept of the gear it is actually the
04:06 way to transmit the energy that's
04:08 created from
04:09 uh one source into another place so in
04:12 specific context of the auto automobile
04:14 you have the engine that's creating the
04:16 internal combustion engine that's
04:18 creating the the uh the rotating energy
04:21 and the gear is used to actually
04:22 transmit
04:23 this energy to the different wheels
04:26 right so that's why it's called a
04:27 transmission because it's transmitting
04:29 the
04:30 the energy from the from the motor to
04:33 the to the different
04:35 different wheels so if you so so this
04:37 company is involved in creating gear
04:39 assemblies that go into this
04:40 transmission right so that is the main
04:43 business of this of this company
04:45 and it has to supply uh mostly to oems
04:49 but also to some tier one companies
04:50 which then create finished transmissions
04:53 right so it does both of these things
04:56 and it has customers in all the parts of
04:58 the country right so basically it is
05:00 supplying to
05:02 oems located in the different regions
05:05 and you'll see that in a bit later on in
05:07 this case study it has a number of
05:09 products right it has a number of
05:11 different types of years here assemblies
05:14 and so on and for the purpose of this
05:16 case study we are actually going to
05:17 consider 10 products just to keep it uh
05:21 more
05:21 easy to follow uh that we will look in
05:24 this case study and and then we talked
05:26 about some of the challenges that an
05:28 industry like this faces right is that
05:30 uh automobile demand is highly variable
05:34 uh as as we all know right so it depends
05:37 on a number of things it depends on
05:39 government policies around and changes
05:41 in those policies it depends on
05:44 uh
05:45 the festive season for example where a
05:48 lot of people try to attend to buy new
05:49 cars
05:51 and so on it depends also on
05:53 availability of parts so right now we
05:55 are for example passing through a phase
05:56 when electronic components are not
05:58 available uh in the way that they used
06:01 to be so now there is a supply challenge
06:03 that comes into the into the industry
06:05 then of course there's labor uh labor of
06:08 people are very important to actually
06:11 run these lines right and create these
06:13 products and sometimes what happened in
06:16 2020 was
06:18 that because of kovit for instance all
06:20 this labor that worked in factories in
06:23 this industry actually went back right
06:26 to their to their native uh towns and
06:29 villages and that meant there was a big
06:31 shortage of labor and of course the
06:33 safety of operating the factory in the
06:35 pandemic so these are all kinds of
06:37 challenges that affect this industry
06:39 right from the demand to the the to the
06:44 supply to all of the resources that are
06:46 required for this industry keeps
06:47 changing over time
06:50 so these challenges seem really really
06:53 large and i'm very curious to see how
06:55 using data perhaps we can break them
06:57 down into smaller challenges right
07:00 absolutely i think data is made a huge
07:04 difference in the productivity uh
07:06 and the cost of of running operations
07:09 for this industry they were one of the
07:11 pioneers to adopt technology uh to run
07:14 their planning and manufacturing and
07:16 procurement operations so if you go way
07:18 back in early 90s uh mahindra mahindra
07:22 was one of the first companies in india
07:23 to implement a full-fledged erp system
07:26 right sap system so this
07:29 you have industry
07:30 explain what this erp system
07:32 i guess yes later maybe which explains
07:34 it
07:36 yes uh i think uh there is a slide in a
07:38 couple of uh slides we have one that
07:40 talks about erp
07:42 okay
07:43 erp is enterprise resource planning huh
07:45 yes erp is enterprise resource planning
07:48 um and we will talk a bit more in detail
07:50 when we uh get to that point but it's
07:52 basically uh the way to integrate all
07:55 the different planning functions of a
07:57 company into one
07:60 single
08:02 base of data right earlier you know you
08:05 used to have different types of data to
08:07 manage different parts of
08:10 of the company or different functions of
08:12 the company
08:12 uh if we go down one or two slides that
08:14 is a slide about erp
08:16 so that actually shows you
08:19 uh
08:22 yes this one um so so as you see here
08:25 right um earlier
08:27 all of these circles used to operate
08:28 independently so you have the finance
08:30 department which has its own accounting
08:32 system and then you had the production
08:34 department which had its own uh
08:36 production tracking system you had the
08:38 human resource department which had its
08:40 own hr system and so on and all of these
08:43 systems are not connected the data was
08:45 not common commonly held right
08:48 in one single database and what that
08:50 meant was the data that production
08:53 shows would be different from the data
08:55 that sales shows or finance shows and
08:57 this used to cost a lot of confusion and
08:60 a lot of error in the way we plan and
09:02 execute the business but with the coming
09:05 of the erp systems uh back in the 80s
09:07 and really accelerated in the 90s and
09:10 the last decade is uh companies are now
09:13 operating out of a single system which
09:15 got integrated database so that once you
09:17 record a product that's produced out in
09:20 the production module it immediately
09:22 updates
09:22 the costs in the costing module it
09:25 updates inventory in the finance module
09:28 it updates the availability in the sales
09:30 module and so on so that everyone is now
09:32 working with the same set of data
09:34 so that is uh a bit about erp but uh as
09:38 i said before uh automotive industry has
09:40 been a very
09:41 forerunner in uh adopting erp systems
09:45 so sure this is this picture is actually
09:48 uh quite interesting because in the fab
09:50 mart case uh we saw
09:52 and perhaps a simplified view where we
09:56 were only talking about infinity
09:57 management planning and finance okay but
10:00 clearly what this picture tells us is
10:02 that you know there are
10:04 many many departments in the company
10:08 and each one of them is doing their own
10:10 bit and all of it has to sort of gel
10:12 together like a gear right
10:14 almost
10:16 yes that's a really interesting analogy
10:18 that is very true and if you look at the
10:19 manufacturing industry and compare it to
10:21 service industry or other industries it
10:24 has got a much broader set of activities
10:28 right
10:28 you know if you look at a trading
10:29 industry or even e-commerce it's really
10:32 about procuring a product and then
10:33 making it available to the customer uh
10:36 in a very fast way right but as if you
10:38 look at this industry it's actually got
10:40 to think about how do i not only procure
10:43 all the components that are required
10:46 to to create my product but also it has
10:48 to schedule all the machines that are
10:50 required to actually convert the
10:52 components into a finished product it
10:55 has to make sure that the labor is
10:56 available at the right place at the
10:57 right time it has to make sure that uh
11:00 the the
11:01 finished product at different stages uh
11:04 of of production are tracked
11:06 appropriately and then it has to think
11:08 about making sure it is distributed to
11:10 the to the right places so that the
11:12 logistics industry can then take it over
11:14 and deliver it to the final point so
11:16 that's why you see a lot more richness
11:19 in uh the business functions in a
11:21 manufacturing industry
11:24 also in an e-commerce example uh that
11:27 million pointed out
11:28 the day that the
11:30 data is already digital in the digital
11:32 form because you sold it electronically
11:33 i presume so you have a digital data
11:36 right from the beginning at the origin
11:37 itself isn't it whereas here presumably
11:40 some
11:41 item will shape the shipment shipping
11:42 voucher and all there are many physical
11:44 records
11:46 when things are physical goods are
11:47 physical and a lot of
11:49 records are also physical i presume and
11:51 so somewhere this physical
11:53 data has to get converted into somebody
11:55 has to make entry right digital
11:56 directory to make this thing into a
11:58 digital data so can you speak about when
12:00 data gets actually entered into the
12:02 system into the erp system
12:04 yes absolutely
12:06 so that's a great point and there are
12:07 many points which are still paper based
12:10 in the industry although the company's
12:13 leading companies are trying to minimize
12:16 how much of physical entries there a
12:18 typical example is when product when
12:20 your raw materials arrive into your
12:22 inventory or store store room right if
12:25 it's a if it's a steel bars or whatever
12:27 that is that that is fine is being
12:29 bought um and so uh somebody has to then
12:33 record that this this has been perceived
12:35 how much has been received in good
12:36 quality and a lot of times you find that
12:39 this is maintained in manual records and
12:41 then later somebody enters that data
12:43 into the system although companies are
12:45 now providing a point of
12:48 you know
12:48 interfaces that people can actually keep
12:50 this and right at the time that they
12:52 received similarly when you're actually
12:53 manufacturing the actual quantity
12:56 produced is actually recorded by
12:58 manufacturing execution systems that are
12:60 attached to the line but from here it
13:02 needs to then travel into the erp system
13:05 so you'll see some data that's coming
13:07 from machine to uh to into the erp
13:10 system as well
13:12 right um so there's number of points
13:14 where
13:14 there is manual information or external
13:18 information that needs to be captured in
13:19 the brp system
13:21 okay
13:24 fantastic so
13:26 uh
13:27 you know why
13:28 you were mentioning that this company
13:31 makes 10 products you know
13:33 and and that
13:35 uh you know
13:37 it's a it's a very large number of
13:38 products so perhaps you can tell us uh
13:41 what are the kind of products that this
13:43 company needs
13:45 yes um so uh as we were saying they they
13:49 do make a number of products and they
13:50 are considered ten of them in this case
13:52 study um
13:54 what you see there is something called a
13:57 gear assembly all the products that we
13:59 are talking about uh here are gear
14:01 assemblies so gear assembly you can
14:03 think of it as a
14:05 more than one gear joined together right
14:07 and there are different types of gears
14:08 there are helical gears power gears all
14:11 these types of things that are used in
14:13 the transmission and we are considering
14:15 uh a gear assembly which is made up made
14:18 out of two gears so the way this
14:21 actually works if you actually go down
14:23 one slide i think it might be easier to
14:25 explain with some pictures
14:27 uh just one more slide here
14:30 yeah
14:31 so so actually yeah go up once
14:34 yeah so so as you can see here on the
14:36 right side you see the gear assembly so
14:39 it's actually got two helical gears that
14:41 are put together
14:43 and what that then does as you can
14:45 imagine is actually transmitting the
14:47 energy that's created in one axis into
14:49 another axis right from vertical to
14:51 horizontal or horizontal
14:54 and
14:55 this gear assembly involves actually two
14:57 gears so as you can see here this is the
14:59 air assembly number three that's then
15:00 sent to the oem but actually it involves
15:03 gears 3a and 3b which are the two gears
15:06 that are part of that assembly right
15:09 now the company has to then make these
15:12 two gears uh and gears are made using a
15:15 two-step process one is called hobbing
15:17 and the other is called approaching so
15:19 hobbing is think of it as the way that
15:22 the external teeth of the gear are
15:24 actually cut and then the broaching in a
15:26 very simple way is the internal things
15:29 like whether it be that uh
15:31 shaft kind of thing that uh allowing it
15:34 to be fit etcetera to be to be made is
15:36 the approaching process
15:38 and the the whole thing starts the blank
15:40 that you see on the left so the the
15:42 company procures these blanks which look
15:44 like that and then they do the hobbing
15:46 process which cuts those teeth that is
15:48 in the outer side and then the broaching
15:50 that finishes the insides and similarly
15:53 it has to make two such gears 3a and 3b
15:56 in a very similar way and then they're
15:58 put together into this assembly and
16:00 quality instruction is done packaging is
16:03 done and then it's sent to the oe right
16:05 so that's the whole process that we are
16:07 going to see
16:08 uh and we're going to see this from uh
16:12 the sales end and working backward
16:14 through the chain right because we're
16:16 going to see how much is the actual
16:17 sales of these assemblies and then we'll
16:20 see
16:20 okay to make those sales you know what's
16:22 the amount of gears we need to make and
16:24 then from there we'll see how how many
16:27 blanks we need to buy and so on so we're
16:29 going to go from the right to the left
16:32 as you proceed to the case study
16:35 so when i hear the word gear right
16:40 i think of uh you know when i change my
16:42 gear in my scooter or on my car
16:45 and that this assembly is what actually
16:48 enables it is it
16:50 absolutely
16:51 there are different uh transmission is a
16:53 very complex mechanism but you can think
16:55 of it as
16:56 there is a certain amount of power and
16:58 talk that the engine can create right
17:01 when you're in a standstill and you want
17:03 to move forward you need a very high
17:05 level of torque
17:07 that means you need a very short gear
17:09 think of it as a way to move your car
17:12 forward uh
17:14 with a with a lot of push right that's
17:16 the torque that it gives but as you get
17:18 more
17:19 you know the vehicle moving now you want
17:21 to
17:22 increase the speed of the vehicle and
17:23 then you are switching to longer and
17:25 longer gears from the shorter gear so
17:28 that you get more revolutions on the
17:30 wheels uh as the car or
17:33 tubular moves forward so that's the
17:35 whole purpose of this transmission is
17:37 actually switch and finger to switch
17:38 from a state of rest to a state of
17:41 increasing speeds uh and that's when the
17:44 horsepower kicks in right when you're on
17:46 a high speed then you want more
17:47 horsepower when you're on a very low
17:49 speed you want more torque and what
17:51 that's what this gear assembly is
17:53 enabled
17:54 and so
17:56 why would i have 10 different kinds of
17:58 gear assemblies because there are
17:60 different car models or there are
18:02 different uh motorcycle modules is it
18:05 yes absolutely so if you think about the
18:07 industry itself there is both passenger
18:09 vehicles and commercial vehicles and the
18:11 company supplies to both of them uh if
18:13 you think of trucks and pickup trucks
18:16 and so on that's a commercial vehicle
18:17 segment and then even within the
18:19 passenger vehicles there are so many
18:20 manufacturers and most of them have
18:22 proprietary uh contributions right they
18:25 make their own or they source it from a
18:27 certain company that is made for that
18:29 particular model so when you look at all
18:31 these different models of transmissions
18:34 then you need a number of different gear
18:36 assemblies that go into it
18:40 so
18:41 in this
18:43 slide you mentioned that there are
18:45 three different kinds of gear assemblies
18:49 yes um what we will cover in the slide
18:51 is we want to illustrate an important
18:53 aspect which was a transition from bar
18:56 at stage four to bar at stage six that
18:58 happened on april 1st
19:01 2020
19:02 so the supreme court
19:04 ruled that
19:06 because of the increasing pollution in
19:08 the country
19:09 and the government of course had
19:11 regulations already in place to move
19:13 from bs4 to bs6 but there was a clear
19:15 ruling that march 31st 2020 was the last
19:18 day that the bs4 equipped vehicles could
19:21 be sold based on the court ruling and so
19:24 what you see here is that there are
19:25 certain assemblies that are used in the
19:28 uh in the car in the transmissions of
19:30 the ps4 types of vehicles so the cars
19:33 that were sold before march 31st 2020
19:36 used gear assemblies that were fit for
19:39 bs4 are
19:40 upgraded for bs4 and then once the new
19:44 norms kicked in on april 1st 2020 the
19:47 industry switched to ps6 and and then
19:50 what happened is some of the parts that
19:52 were in the transmission act to be
19:54 redesigned
19:56 and made more
19:57 stronger and more resilient
20:00 to support bs6
20:02 so what happened is in of the 10 gear
20:04 assemblies that we're going to discuss
20:05 in this case study there are six of them
20:07 that can be used or that were used in
20:10 both the bs4 and bs6 transmissions the
20:13 reason being that those particular gear
20:15 assemblies did not get affected because
20:17 of this trans transition they continue
20:19 to be used but there are two parts or
20:21 two assemblies that were stopped um you
20:25 know uh when the bs4 ended because those
20:28 gear assemblies could only be used in
20:29 the older bs4 transmissions and there
20:32 are two parts that actually were new
20:35 parts that started selling just before
20:37 the transition to bs6 happened
20:39 and these parts are specifically made
20:41 for bs6
20:43 requirements or changes because of the
20:45 bs6
20:46 requirements in the transmission so
20:48 these two parts are new parts that only
20:51 start selling very close to the date of
20:53 the launch of the ps6 vapors so you'll
20:56 see all these examples in the data
20:58 because you'll see the
20:60 assemblies one and two which are bs4
21:01 which you will see that they stop their
21:03 sales or the sales stop uh they drop off
21:06 and then they stop when before bs six
21:09 norms kick in and then you'll see six
21:11 parts which continue their sales because
21:13 they are not affected by the transition
21:15 and you'll see two assemblies that
21:17 actually start the sales just before the
21:21 bs6
21:23 so shift
21:25 sorry then it's very good
21:27 this pattern
21:29 where you see one one type going down
21:31 another type going up and so on is very
21:33 typical in manchester right because
21:35 whenever there's a technology change or
21:37 when a model is discontinued another
21:38 model is introduced you will see these
21:40 transitions isn't it you'll see
21:41 transition from one type to another
21:44 yes absolutely i mean some of this is
21:46 regulatory like from the government but
21:48 there's a lot of other changes that come
21:49 because a new model is introduced or a
21:52 new generation of a car is actually
21:54 introduced so if you look at a very
21:56 popular car like honda city right it's
21:58 it's had four or five generations every
22:01 six seven years a new generation comes
22:03 and when you have a new generation of a
22:05 car um almost everything gets changed
22:08 it's a new engine typically there's a
22:09 new transmission so when those things
22:12 happen as well the component suppliers
22:14 and the uh the tier one suppliers all
22:17 have to quickly adapt to that change and
22:20 start making new assemblies or new parts
22:22 to to cater to the the new model
22:25 the
22:26 the new model generation of the
22:28 manufacturer right so a lot of changes
22:30 like this keep happening they're just
22:32 uh showing in here just one change from
22:35 vs4 to l6
22:37 and
22:39 so so sure the thing that strikes me is
22:41 that if i make too many bs4 uh
22:45 assemblies
22:46 and bs4 cars are no longer being sold
22:50 then i have a problem no because i will
22:52 not be able to sell those assemblies uh
22:55 going forward
22:56 so i need to plan ahead and figure out
22:60 exactly how much i want to make
23:02 absolutely i think you you hit on a very
23:04 important point there milan this is why
23:07 planning is so important in this
23:08 industry right because um there is there
23:11 is a lead time involved in everything
23:13 right so so if a manufacturer has to
23:16 start for example uh making new bs6 cars
23:19 or stop making bs4 cars
23:22 then usually let's take the example of
23:24 the bf6 right the manufacturers start
23:26 selling new bs6 cars on april 1st that
23:29 means they have to start making the cars
23:31 at least one or two months ahead
23:33 because then they they have to reach the
23:34 cars to the showroom sometimes
23:37 and then if the manufacturer has to
23:38 start a month ahead then
23:40 the assembly supplier of the assemblies
23:42 that go into the transmission they have
23:44 to start probably two months ahead
23:47 to start providing these parts so that
23:49 then that can get built and so it goes
23:52 right if you have if you have to uh
23:54 provide those parts to one side then the
23:56 actual raw material the gear blank maker
23:58 will probably have to do three months
23:60 ahead before that and so the planning is
24:02 so important in this industry and time
24:05 we call it the time phased planning so
24:07 you have to actually look at buckets of
24:09 time whether it be months weeks etc and
24:12 you have to say how much am i going to
24:14 make and sell in those buckets and
24:16 therefore
24:17 what does it mean for the previous
24:19 bucket for another part of my own
24:21 factory or my supplier and then and go
24:24 backward like that so
24:26 as we get into the data you'll see the
24:28 time buckets that we use in this mostly
24:31 the monthly buckets for the two years
24:33 and you'll see how the transitions
24:35 actually affect many months ahead of the
24:38 actual change happening at the end at
24:40 the end of the day
24:43 so gdp i think in the fab mart case also
24:45 we looked at a little bit of this timing
24:48 variability but there we had only 15
24:50 days data so we couldn't see too much
24:52 all right we could see any trends in
24:54 fact there hopefully we'll see more
24:56 trends in this one because it's monthly
24:57 and for a period i think two year data
24:59 we have let's see how it looks
25:01 right right
25:05 so ship why don't you introduce us to
25:07 some of the people in this country
25:10 yes absolutely there are we'll consider
25:12 different roles as we go through the
25:14 case study
25:15 just to show you all the different
25:17 departments that are involved in
25:18 actually planning
25:20 scheduling
25:21 procuring and manufacturing right so the
25:23 first role we'll see is the sales
25:25 manager who is responsible for planning
25:27 the sales of these gear assemblies and
25:29 forecasting how many how many we need in
25:31 the future
25:32 uh that's archana and then you'll hear
25:34 from swarup who is a production
25:36 scheduler
25:37 who has to then make sure that the
25:39 machines the hobby approaching and other
25:41 machines are appropriately loaded with
25:44 the right kind of plans to make the
25:45 right kind of gears and assemblies uh
25:48 you'll also see the shop floor manager
25:50 who is responsible for the day-to-day
25:51 inventory work in progress which means
25:54 the product that are still being made on
25:55 the floor of the factory and the
25:57 finished goods goes francis and then
25:60 you'll also see razia who's a purchasing
26:02 manager who has to make sure that the
26:04 raw materials are procured in time the
26:06 blanks are procured so that
26:08 there is no stoppage to any of the
26:10 machines for want of raw materials yet
26:13 trying to make sure we have the right
26:14 amount of uh raw materials that we don't
26:17 overly
26:18 stock more than what we need because
26:20 every every item you stock there's a
26:22 cost to buying and stocking that you'll
26:25 also hear from chandra who's a finance
26:27 manager
26:28 who's concerned with profitability
26:30 revenue and other accounting related
26:33 items uh because at the end of the day
26:35 the company has to make money we have to
26:37 make sure your products are profitable
26:39 cash is collected at the right time from
26:41 uh from the customers and so on so
26:44 you'll hear hear from chandra and also
26:46 you will talk about ashish's role who's
26:48 the human resources manager because to
26:51 run all these machines and think of the
26:52 factory where there's so many hobbing
26:54 machines so many approaching machines so
26:56 many assembly lines you need a lot of uh
26:59 workforce uh both own workforce
27:01 employees and contract workforce that is
27:04 available to run these machines to
27:06 inspect the products of quality and all
27:08 that so workforce planning is another
27:10 key element
27:12 of manufacturing and we will also meet
27:15 all of these people as we go through the
27:17 case study
27:18 so so gee looks like the finance people
27:22 do roughly the same activity in all
27:24 companies because in fab mart also over
27:27 the finance uh
27:29 uh person the cfo who had roughly
27:31 similar concerns right but inventory
27:34 here
27:35 uh
27:36 that looks a little different i think
27:38 because there
27:40 it was more about sales right it was
27:42 more about
27:44 pushing things to customers while here
27:46 it is more about sourcing from suppliers
27:50 it's a combination it's both i think
27:51 yeah yeah there is also this interesting
27:54 work in progress which will never be
27:56 there in a commerce company
27:58 correct
27:59 so it's a little bit
28:01 of difference but i think the finance
28:03 guys
28:04 are largely the same in all companies
