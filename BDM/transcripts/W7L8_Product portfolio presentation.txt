00:00 [Music]
00:14 so shim the other thing that we did was
00:18 we also looked at the revenue
00:20 uh
00:21 in
00:22 the two financial years
00:24 uh across gear assemblies
00:27 uh is this something that is of interest
00:30 to his gears or uh this is uh this is
00:33 not interesting
00:35 it is it is highly of interest and i
00:37 think it answers the question that we
00:38 talked about earlier which is
00:40 which are the products that's giving me
00:43 the most revenue right almost um
00:46 bringing in the money right for the
00:48 company and so if you see here the green
00:50 product gear assembly number seven
00:52 it's actually fetched in 2019 to 21 the
00:56 uh
00:57 the the two years together which is the
00:59 first two columns
01:01 it's actually fetched uh 10 crores right
01:04 that's what it shows so
01:06 so
01:07 uh that's a that's a very uh very strong
01:10 contribution that's coming from that one
01:12 product right out of the total sales of
01:15 uh
01:16 41 crore uh 12 lakhs that you see at the
01:19 bottom
01:19 about a fourth of that revenue actually
01:22 are more than uh one fourth right more
01:24 than 25 is coming from just one product
01:27 um
01:28 so so that is the significant insight
01:31 that you are giving through this
01:32 analysis right with that queen and
01:34 similarly the first
01:36 contributor or the lowest contributor is
01:38 actually gear assembly nine because it's
01:40 only fetched uh
01:42 one crew out of 41 cores so only two
01:45 percent two and a half percent is coming
01:47 from that product uh again partly
01:49 because of it's a bs6 product so it did
01:51 not have revenues in the first year it
01:53 only kicked in in the second year right
01:56 um
01:58 but you can see that um
01:60 uh it is uh overall uh not contributing
02:03 that much right with all the investment
02:04 that gone into bs6 is it really been
02:07 worth it this is
02:09 for this product right that's one
02:11 question that i could i could see and
02:13 then another thing that this uh kind of
02:15 analysis is showing is the bs4 products
02:18 are quickly falling off in 20 20 20 21
02:21 because
02:22 from april 1st 20 to 20 no bs6 products
02:25 could be sold so the gear assembly one
02:28 and two have dropped down to zero
02:30 revenue
02:31 in the second year right which is also
02:34 coming out nicely in this
02:39 should your audio is again having a lot
02:41 of static
02:45 not sure
02:47 can you hear me
02:49 yes
02:51 yeah
02:52 um so maybe i'll just pick up the the
02:55 final item right which is that
02:58 the gear assembly one and two the
03:00 revenue have fallen off completely in
03:02 2021 because they were bs4 products
03:06 so this analysis also clearly shows that
03:08 uh
03:09 the
03:10 the bs4 products um
03:12 have uh
03:14 actually
03:15 led to loss of revenue and so then you
03:17 can also ask a question was the revenue
03:20 of the bso products made up
03:23 by or are compensated sufficiently by
03:25 the revenue from the bs6 products
03:28 and
03:29 that is possibly looking at
03:31 the 20 19 20 revenues
03:34 uh
03:35 in
03:36 and then
03:37 for the one and two and comparing it
03:39 with the 20 20 21 for the 9 and 10
03:42 and i guess the answer is not fully
03:44 right but to some extent it was
03:46 compensating
03:48 right
03:49 right
03:51 and i think that's largely because
03:53 assembly nine doesn't seem to have
03:55 contributed as much as we expected
03:59 yes correct in this particular case um
04:02 they had to do a redesign of their some
04:04 of their
04:06 bs6 vehicles because of some issues
04:09 discovered
04:10 subsequently so so
04:12 this particular
04:14 there was a delay in the launch of that
04:15 particular model of vehicle and that
04:17 contributed
04:19 the gear assembly being very low in
04:21 sales
04:23 right
04:28 yes and again uh there's a graphical
04:30 view i think uh it summarizes what you
04:33 just explained to us
04:37 absolutely
04:43 yeah i think it's nice to know uh
04:45 uh the also the impact of forward right
04:48 uh
04:49 in the fact that
04:51 uh if you look at 20 uh 1920 you know
04:54 some of the
04:55 the revenues are actually quickly
04:57 dropping off on nine and oh sorry bs be
04:60 a six impact for nine and ten uh falls
05:02 to zero but importantly it also shows
05:05 that for gear assembly
05:07 uh nine and ten right although the
05:11 uh if you look at
05:13 1920 they they are actually being
05:15 launched in uh 2021 but already in 1920
05:20 they started to see some uptick in
05:23 in sales
05:26 right and right how do you explain that
05:27 is it because the lead time
05:30 yes
05:31 the lead that's required to uh
05:34 prime the the whole manufacturing system
05:37 right so the components are to be
05:39 produced well ahead of
05:41 the finished products
05:48 we'll pause here
05:58 okay did we want to kick this off
06:04 this one
06:05 yeah so this is basically what we have
06:08 done
06:09 just so that you know gv what we've done
06:11 is we've clustered these uh uh
06:14 gear assemblies into three categories
06:16 bs4 only bs6 only and bs4 and basd
06:20 plot
06:33 saw here was that every composite lovely
06:35 picture
06:36 now we are trying to see whether we can
06:37 see a picture for
06:39 revenues gearwise
06:42 gear not individual gearwise but
06:44 category ones
06:45 so you put all the ps4 revenues together
06:47 we via six revenues together and the bs4
06:49 b6 those gears which are
06:51 gear assemblies that can be used for
06:52 both four and six together so
06:55 vs4 bs46 and bs6
06:58 and of course the comp total revenues
07:00 all of them put together those revenues
07:02 also were put
07:03 in one chart so
07:05 this allows us to see what's happening
07:07 to the bs4 revenues what's happening to
07:09 the b6 revenues what's happening to the
07:11 one set bs4 and six together
07:16 yes
07:19 yes i think this is also quite
07:20 insightful because it shows the patterns
07:23 right in the
07:24 in the transition that happened so the
07:27 blue line which is a bs4 line completely
07:30 dries up by february right well ahead of
07:32 the transition because we can't we can't
07:34 produce any more
07:36 uh after february because it would not
07:38 be there would not be enough time to put
07:40 that into a finished vehicle and sell it
07:42 because the court the supreme court had
07:44 said no sales after april 1st 2020 and
07:48 similarly br6 you can see a pickup
07:49 starting in february it's slowly rising
07:52 february 20 and then
07:54 through the year after the recovery from
07:56 coverage it's steadily increasing
07:59 in the revenue and you can also see the
08:01 overall pattern that it took us almost
08:03 24 months to get to that 25
08:06 lakh level right or
08:08 250 uh 2.5 crore
08:10 monthly revenue level uh which we
08:13 reached in uh
08:14 you know early part of the 2019
08:17 financial year
08:18 uh then there's only one month where we
08:20 reached again
08:21 november 19 2019 and then it took us
08:25 almost one and a half years to touch
08:27 those back to that
08:29 yeah
08:31 shall we start i'll start projecting
08:33 yep
08:34 you know
08:36 yeah i mean i mean you won't see
08:38 anything different but
08:39 here you just see the graph
08:42 so this we've repeated the same thing
08:43 shape what we did with revenue we did
08:45 with quantity just to see if the
08:46 reference that comes out when you look
08:48 at quantity
08:50 because it could well be that
08:54 something something volume volume-wise
08:56 something is doing well
08:58 and even though it may not be
08:59 contributing in terms of revenue as much
09:01 as but in terms of volume it might be
09:02 keeping the factory busy i don't know so
09:04 we said okay let us look at
09:06 the quantity picture
09:09 yes and uh now in the quantity picture
09:11 it seems that gear assembly six
09:13 is the one that is doing the best
09:17 yes that is quite interesting right so
09:19 when we looked at the overall
09:22 revenue we saw that seven was the one
09:25 that was giving
09:26 the the most
09:28 [Music]
09:29 sales revenue uh but when you look at
09:31 quantities
09:32 uh it is actually six that is the
09:35 highest selling gear so this shows the
09:38 difference in the contributions on the
09:40 unit cost of these years right so seven
09:43 sold only
09:44 uh 1.38 lakhs in the two years right uh
09:49 whereas six sold 2.21 lakhs units but um
09:53 if i go back to the revenues picture uh
09:56 seven actually was
09:58 giving us almost
09:59 two to three times the revenue of uh six
10:02 hmm
10:03 is because
10:04 the gear assembly six is possibly a very
10:07 low cost which is used in volume models
10:10 such as hatchback or compact hatchback
10:13 which sells in large volumes if you look
10:15 at the top ten sales of cars in india
10:18 usually the top spots are occupied by
10:19 cars like
10:21 the swift uh or the wagon ah or the
10:25 the maruti 800 those types of cars which
10:28 are
10:29 you know very large numbers but their
10:32 unit selling price is quite much smaller
10:34 than other cars so the gears that go
10:36 into those types of models are typically
10:38 high volume low low unit price so gear 6
10:42 could be one of those whereas if you
10:44 look at gear 7 it could be the one that
10:47 goes more in
10:49 suvs or mid price kind of cars or you
10:53 know mid high end cars
10:55 where there is sufficient volume today
10:57 the car the mid size and seven segment
10:60 which is occupied by the likes of the
11:02 hindi creator
11:03 uh
11:04 the kia celtos and the newly launched
11:07 like skoda footshock and all those
11:09 segments right the volume is very high
11:11 and also is a value
11:13 the volume is maybe not as high as a
11:15 hatchback but it is quite high and the
11:17 value is quite high because
11:19 these
11:20 components need to take higher torque
11:23 and
11:24 higher power and so on so so that could
11:26 be where the
11:27 seven belongs where this move both
11:29 reasonably good volume but also
11:32 good unit cost unit price
11:36 so what struck me uh as interesting chev
11:40 and wanted your uh insect into this is
11:43 that gear assembly six
11:45 uh seems to have dropped quite a bit
11:48 from 1920 to 2021
11:52 but gear assembly seven did not drop uh
11:54 similarly right so we went from
11:58 147k to 73k 74k for uh gear assembly six
12:03 so um we saw that revenue um
12:08 there were some interesting observations
12:09 on revenue some interesting observations
12:11 on quantity so can we see revenue and
12:12 quantity together is the next question
12:14 we asked and
12:16 the best way to depict because there are
12:17 two dimensions we thought that the best
12:19 way to defect would be a scatter plot
12:22 so if you can bring up the scatter plot
12:25 yeah so
12:27 this is what we did plotted the two-year
12:30 revenue and the two-year sales quantity
12:33 uh
12:34 on x-axis and y-axis
12:37 uh and we were trying to see if there
12:39 were some trends okay so we tried to fit
12:42 in uh some kind of a trend line through
12:44 linear regression
12:47 uh i'm not sure if that trend line gives
12:50 us any information what is
12:52 your uh
12:54 how how do you
12:55 look at this when you look at it
12:57 from the company's point of view
12:60 yes
13:01 this is very interesting chart i really
13:03 like this chart because it gives us a
13:05 lot of insights on the product portfolio
13:08 so this is a very important strategic
13:10 function of companies called portfolio
13:12 management where they have to look at
13:15 their entire set of products and figure
13:16 out which ones we want to focus more on
13:19 which product lines we want to grow and
13:22 which product lines we want to get out
13:24 of right so if you look at this chart
13:26 there's number of insights that actually
13:28 come in here
13:29 first of all the first thing that
13:32 top management wants to look at in in
13:34 these things is what are the most
13:36 important products for us and usually
13:38 most important would translate to
13:40 a high revenue
13:43 right uh that being the the most uh
13:46 significant thing right and high
13:47 profitability we don't have the
13:49 profitability dimension here but you can
13:51 see that gear assembly 7 is a very
13:53 important product because it's bringing
13:55 in
13:55 the highest revenues of all the 10
13:58 products that we have right so that is
13:60 significant and the fact that the
14:02 quantity is not very high
14:04 indicates that it's also a very valuable
14:07 product right per unit price is quite
14:09 high for that product
14:11 so that is one inside the other part
14:14 that we want to look at is what's our
14:16 like if you're similar to the look at
14:18 abc of the raw material right you can
14:20 also think about an abc of the finished
14:23 product where you say other products
14:25 that give that we want to
14:28 make a lot of quantities but doesn't
14:30 really give a lot of revenues so you can
14:33 see that gear assembly six is kind of
14:35 like that where the sales quantity is an
14:37 important product because it is giving
14:39 decent revenue it is actually probably
14:42 the second highest revenue earning right
14:44 if you look at the horizontal or third
14:46 is revenue earning product so it's not
14:48 unimportant but it is um consuming a lot
14:51 of effort because we have to make a lot
14:53 of quantities to reach that revenue so
14:55 it is an important product maybe not as
14:57 important as
14:58 the gear assembly seven and then you see
15:01 uh what we call the products that
15:03 actually are
15:05 fetching
15:06 they're high in
15:08 high in quantity but
15:10 low in in terms of revenue
15:12 so if you see
15:14 uh you know some of those products like
15:15 gear assembly two
15:17 um and so on uh fit in that category and
15:20 the final one is where we have
15:23 insignificant quantity in significant
15:25 revenue so gear assembly number nine
15:27 seems to be like that where
15:29 uh you know the quantity is less so is
15:31 the revenue and we know that the
15:32 specific reason for this is because a
15:34 particular automobile model took time to
15:37 take off so it is too early to conclude
15:39 that we should kill that product but if
15:42 this was happening year over year we
15:44 might kill that product right because
15:46 why
15:47 uh spend efforts on a product that
15:50 doesn't sell much and doesn't give us a
15:52 lot of
15:53 revenue as well so so you could think of
15:55 this
15:56 this chart as a very insightful chart
15:58 that helps us to make those portfolio
16:00 decisions on products right
16:02 and if you look at the kind of line that
16:04 shows
16:05 uh you know i would be very interested
16:14 the revenue is high the quantity is high
16:17 or at least
16:19 the two right quadrants for the revenue
16:21 side right that would be
16:23 of most interest to uh to
16:27 your company management typically but it
16:29 is a good chart another chart that's
16:31 used very
16:34 commonly in portfolio management is by
16:37 looking at um the trend of
16:41 uh
16:42 products over time right so um what are
16:45 the products that are new products that
16:47 are that has just recently been
16:49 introduced but they are growing very
16:51 fast what are those products that are
16:53 stable products that we've been handing
16:55 up on food for long which are kind of
16:57 our cash cows right the the new products
17:00 that are growing very fast and
17:01 profitable are the stars and then you
17:04 have
17:04 products which are old which are
17:06 declining in revenue and which are also
17:08 not profitable which are kind of the dog
17:11 products right so that's another chart
17:12 that's very commonly used in portfolio
17:15 management kind of decisions
17:17 so the cash cow so you're made made into
17:19 animals except for stars
17:23 and you have a star okay
17:26 and uh
17:27 is there anything else you have a pig
17:28 you don't have anything
17:31 i forget the last quadrant right there
17:33 is there is high growth high margin
17:36 uh products and there is high margin
17:39 um you know stable products and there is
17:41 no margin
17:43 low growth products and there's one more
17:45 which i'm forgetting but yeah that's a
17:47 very common analysis that we use for
17:49 portfolio
17:50 okay
