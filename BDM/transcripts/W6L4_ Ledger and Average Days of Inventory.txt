00:00 foreign [Music]
00:17 that is coming up with respect to inventory managing inventory
00:23 is whether or not we have enough material sitting in our
00:29 go down depose to take care of the sales that are
00:34 happening we have sales going on yeah but do we have enough stock enough stock yeah
00:41 so if you don't have stock then basically we may not be able to fulfill sales that's the problem actually right
00:46 correct so how do we know whether we have enough stock or not it's a question right uh so that is analysis that
00:54 roughly we wanted to do sure so I guess uh the key information here is how much
00:59 stock we have so let's let's do that let's uh I think there is a sheet that
01:05 omkar had given us called open Stock okay and what it tells us is how much stock
01:11 for each sko they had in Hyderabad Cochin and Madras uh on at the time they opened the
01:19 warehouse on the first day okay so what we should do is perhaps
01:24 calculate the total yeah we're not doing it by city by City we'll do as a whole
01:29 look at total yeah so I think as an exercise some students can basically work on City wise yeah right
01:37 yes yes but let's do it totally yeah so we will say sum of
01:45 B2 to D2 right Okay Okay so we've got it so this
01:52 is the opening stock this is the opening stock across cities across cities okay that we have now I need to know 518
02:01 is the opening stock for f01 I need to know how many days 518 will
02:06 last for me okay how do we find that out so let's do one thing we
02:14 we can create a pivot sheet so let's find out how much we sell of f01 every day if we did this one that
02:21 you have that sheet is there huh that cheese sales data all right it's okay I'll just recreate uh
02:28 it's do we have it in series oh yeah we have it in sales data
02:33 but we will still need to create a pivot table out of this why do we oh by date we did now
02:39 trendline we didn't we we did it but I I'll have to look at which sheet that
02:44 data is so I'll just create a new version yeah yeah you can create one it's easy to create just create by so
02:51 you're saying by date right yeah create a pivot table
02:57 dollar dollar a Solan dollars G
03:03 and now what we want is by date that's what you wanted right you want by
03:09 date you want volume correct volume but you want for a single
03:16 HQ oh right correct that's the difference so now what you can do is to put
03:25 there is a additional area in the uh pivot table called filter
03:31 so we will use skus as filter okay so now here it will allow you to
03:38 filter let's say I only want F1 so I can select F1
03:45 f01 and now what it's telling me is what is my yeah yeah that's the true that is
03:51 true I want to do it by Escape correct correct yeah that's a big difference yes yes so you want I want also opening
03:57 stock file if you want the opening stock okay on the sheet yeah so we'll look it up
04:04 opens talk and here what we will do is we'll say we
04:11 look up and for vlookup we want to vlookup B1
04:19 and the data we want is in open Stock see open stock
04:26 from A1 we want dollar a dollar one no
04:34 yeah do another one
04:41 two dollar e dollar 31
04:47 yeah correct comma five comma
04:53 one two three four five correct five false right yeah
04:58 yeah it's not work all right yeah yeah so actually one
05:06 thing we should increase the size of the sheet 175 we should so now the only thing let's just check
05:13 if I change the filter cell does think do things work so let me
05:18 instead of F1 let's take F2 and it does seem to change right but see
05:25 what it is 272 opens up 272. ah all right okay okay all right
05:35 so now I want to see okay let's say 272. 272 Loop goes how many days 272 goes for
05:40 how many days so then we will do this cumulative sales no yeah foreign
05:59 first thing is B4 and the new one is
06:06 this one Plus B5
06:12 right yeah and then you double click that
06:18 yeah good decision I'll remove because this is
06:24 so what are we seeing we are saying 272 showing up the last up till ninth last
06:31 year yeah on day 10 we will run out of date and we'll run out
06:37 um yeah ninth last or nine days it'll last for nine days but I mean it's cheating a
06:43 little bit because you're looking forward yeah so how many uh you're
06:48 you're at ideally you're at one four correct you're sitting on an opening stock of 272. correct you don't know
06:54 what sales is going to be forget about tomorrow you don't even know for today one thing we can do is we can just divide to 72 by 26 what is 26 which is
07:03 the day sale on the first day that's one okay so at the end of today I can do it
07:10 at the end of today I can do it and I have the sales data for today correct I can divide 272 assume that every day is
07:15 going to be like today yeah 272 long assumption no 11 days something it gives
07:21 some one indicator no no you should do better than that you should do you should do better than uh average
07:27 of past data yeah right we don't have past data okay but you know so we can
07:35 say that this 15 days period is typical whatever average you're getting ah
07:40 correct that is right the average you are going to get for this 15 days is like the average would
07:46 should have been it will be there any time in the past 15 days because there's some growth correct just for growth
07:52 required yeah something like that something like that okay yeah so take the average okay some gross number you
07:58 put on that the simplest thing to do is I can do average
08:08 daily sales
08:14 what like this you can see average off
08:23 B4 to be 18. correct correct
08:30 so 28.6 is the average huh so you should divide 272 by 28.6 so and
08:36 we will say days of see it
08:44 available yeah correct yeah yeah assuming of course at
08:51 the average that you're getting for this 12 15 day period is very similar to the spelling mistake
08:57 what you're saying is the average of these 15 days is very similar to the average that could have been there correct
09:03 fast also last 15 days also would be roughly similar may be slightly different but yeah I think that makes
09:10 sense foreign
09:17 this divided by average yeah
09:23 and roughly nine inches cumulative also we came to roughly the same thing yes because the days it's not
09:29 changing that much correct for this Escape some other Escape it may change yes so we can try it try another sqlc
09:35 and try you want to see m01
09:41 let's say yeah yeah less times you know yeah CFO will anyway ask us this question
09:50 what happened m01 right days of sales available is only 3.6 oh
09:57 you see there it was 9.5 the average daily says 60 yeah and they're 220 okay
10:05 because the supply is not coming in try something else try some L type things let's try and
10:12 type thing let's try l01
10:19 uh comfortable six and a half days six and a half days okay
10:25 so this is a way this is one way this is one way it's one way so what what we've done basically here is that we have taken the
10:31 open stock not comfortable okay we will see open Stock and then we divided that by
10:38 uh average sales average sales of that stock of that uh SKU and we are saying
10:45 okay with this open Stock how many days I can go correct but the days the stock is declining or maybe declined we don't
10:51 know yes yes some stock is coming in so in M1 there's something selling
10:57 something coming in also right uh yes so if well Hyderabad we don't have a
11:02 picture because Hyderabad things are coming from suppliers but in the case of
11:08 Madras as an example we know that there is stock coming in from Hyderabad so Madras if you take fake madrosity okay
11:14 we can take for Madras there is stock coming in going out to the ceiling yes
11:20 resell it goes out yes and stock is coming in correct so what's
11:25 happening to our staff so it may be increasing decreasing okay let's just take first of April right we
11:31 know how much stock there was in the morning yeah we know how much stock we sold huh yeah
11:39 now uh also we know how much stock came in actually this data was given to us
11:44 so we know that this much stock came in
11:50 right seven units came in yeah yeah so from that we should be able to
11:56 compute how much stock was there at the end of the day in midrash
12:03 so you have opening stock minus how much better how much went out
12:08 plus how much came in would be the closing stock for first for
12:13 the first and that will be the opening surface again for a second like that and then you keep repeating
12:19 this so like cumulative sum yeah accumulate this accumulate this so let's talk okay shall we try doing
12:27 that I don't know you lose this is something yeah we'll have to do it
12:33 in Excel so okay let's try that let's try this so what you're saying is that we'll take
12:40 we'll take the opening stock as on first or favorite or any day actually opening stock yes on the first of April is given
12:47 other days are calculated so so let's do one thing okay let's take sales data
12:52 and let's first thing we should do is always create pivot tables right so we
12:60 will create a pivot table from
13:10 sales data controller a
13:17 colon dollar G here again we're doing SQ user
13:23 yeah so we wanted SKU wise but we wanted to buy uh so we want first let's take skus rows
13:31 okay let me increase the size
13:37 k u y is stock position daily top position no so first thing we will do is
13:43 we want to know what is the SKU wise uh outflow for Madras
13:50 okay I think you want to First calculator yeah let's first write it yeah yeah columns are
13:57 States okay
14:02 and this is sales sales that's how it go
14:09 so that tells you the daily outgo format from address no and I need to take City in the filters
14:18 and select mirrors
14:27 okay okay let us quite fast okay so what we have calculated is the daily outgo from address correct okay device device
14:37 okay what we know is the opening
14:43 uh you know the opening stock right so let me know do one thing let me create a
14:50 uh new sheet
14:56 and this sheet I will call Madras
15:05 Ledger correct laser okay okay
15:10 and in this lecture what I will do is
15:16 I will first Ledger keeps track of what comes and goes now like what these kirana people
15:22 keep track of yes in Daily incoming and God going at the end of the day reconcile correct right correct
15:30 they always reconciled end of the day if it's not reconciled they will not sleep yeah
15:35 they have to reconcile okay yeah mandatory now what we need to do is we
15:41 want opening stock huh
15:47 we want sales
15:53 we want size increases yeah
16:09 okay
16:15 inward removed stock
16:21 and we want closing stop no yeah
16:27 closing stock can be nice you know uh it could I guess right
16:36 which we should at least set it to zero now it can't physically be negative you know what okay
16:42 of course you can see the point is invert stock is coming into Chennai sales is we can have sales because sales
16:48 can happen they can take sales even though we don't have stock internet yes so your principle actually sales can
16:55 be more than opening but opening stock can never be negative so if the previous days closing stock is negative you will
17:02 have closing stock and negative but opening stocks at least zero yeah yeah so here I will say first April
17:11 2021 right so let's just first do it for first of April so in this case it's so
17:16 okay here let's do it yeah so this is going to be equal to V look equal to
17:23 uh yeah I can do we look because you can just copy that
17:28 column button this is a better way of doing it yes you look up
17:35 a four a four comma open Stock sheet
17:45 okay stock dollar a dollar one
17:54 important color e dollar 31 you know
18:04 comma I want if this is one two three four
18:10 four is what I want um and then false correct yeah correct
18:16 correct correct okay
18:22 okay this is opening star no sales sales also I just created an Excel sheet
18:29 pivot table right yeah this I can just
18:36 do this
18:41 is going to be a little bit painful actually what we need to do is two levels of vlookup but
18:48 uh I'll cheat a little bit okay and I'll just take this data so we will say this
18:54 is equals
18:59 from sheet 18. oh I see we look because you have to look up one first April I have to look up first April honestly so
19:06 that is going to be a little tricky but anyway you're going in order yeah so but you have to keep this one that is
19:12 something because we have columns in between columns it won't be that easy we'll see we'll see okay some tricks
19:18 so right now I'm just going to cheat okay you know later thing we'll we'll show the
19:24 students how to do this okay okay so this is sales
19:30 right now inward stock is available from stock
19:36 transfer oh my goodness this is something huh okay okay all right and again there is
19:44 okay like that take it I take that I'm just going to take this yeah only going to the next one is going to be
19:50 interesting huh okay now this is going to be
19:56 this minus sales plus invert
20:04 what is it oh nice nice okay just doubt like that we'll see what happens now
20:10 none of them are negative let's go down let's see if anything negative okay are all positive but in any case so
20:16 let me just copy Edition
20:27 let's make this second favorite
20:33 so now we want to opening stock same as the previous talk except if it
20:38 is below zero okay so I will say Max of Ah that's the way to do it
20:45 you would have done anything yeah this is a very good way to do it that was that if zeros and things so this this
20:51 will do it yeah right
20:58 yeah now sales again and again this is not a
21:04 very healthy way uh but right now let's just do it like this
21:10 so we want C5 right
21:19 so what you keep doing it for every day for every day ideally at some point we
21:25 should automate this okay and
21:30 so there is an offset function but what I thought we
21:36 will do it is leave it a little later in the course okay to introduce the offset function okay okay we'll do it for two
21:43 days we'll see what happens then then this will
21:50 inward stop no
21:57 and then closing stock is exactly
22:04 the same formula
22:11 I'm going to write
22:20 negative okay no
22:26 but some are coming very close to zero you say our guests look if you look at
22:32 the data would be M1 right so M1 we started with 64.
22:38 it has gone down to 38.
22:43 so we wanted to do I mean we wanted to improve this what we calculated right we calculated that uh number of number of
22:51 days of inventory number of days of sales days of sales how many days what cover we have correct this one but now
22:56 we want to do it in a much more accurate way because this Ledger thing gives us a insight into the stock position not just
23:03 on the opening day but also as it progresses yes so can we and we also see
23:09 that later on you know you're getting negative so it means that we are getting stockouts beginning without getting stock outs correct we talk about later
23:14 on correct so rather than taking the inventory stock position on the opening day can we
23:21 not take the Average stock position we can do that so let's try and calculate the average how many days of
23:29 average uh sales yes is covered by the average Stockbridge yes which would give us some
23:36 kind of average days of inventory correct right correct how many days how many inventory days we have so let me
23:42 insert a new worksheet and I'll call it mattress
23:48 days of inventory
23:53 and let me set it to 175.
24:00 now we want what we want average average sales
24:07 average open stock NOW first I always open Stock average sales and we want
24:13 average sales is already available somewhere no we want average sales by day
24:20 well yeah it's available in some form but really anyway we can compute it because we have now got
24:25 yeah okay so what we need to do is we need to find the average if the
24:32 corresponding label is uh open stock right so for that it is a function
24:37 called averages and what average if we'll expect us to
24:42 be a bridge is normally average but we are now going to do I will only take numbers into my average computation if
24:50 their label is open Stock okay okay all right okay so I look at this column
24:57 and what I say is so first I'll say what are the labels I'm looking at the uh
25:05 just so it should be not before B3 right
25:13 sorry B 3 2 B 3 2 p i three e i three and this I just want
25:22 to make sure that this I protect with dollars the range is fixed
25:29 the labels are fixed labels are fixed okay and this I'm only interested in something that is
25:37 labeled open Stock okay and if that is the case then what
25:43 average is then I am going to take the average of
25:51 in this what I will do is I'll protect the bees I won't protect the rows okay
25:58 okay knock out the zeros little bit
26:06 and same way do this
26:14 right and now instead of open Stock I want to call it
26:21 sales
26:27 I see this is what is is it okay correct no
26:32 yeah sales correct yeah okay and then you drag that up so I will just drag
26:39 both of them
26:45 wow wow this is what so what are we saying
26:51 you're saying that uh we are divided let's divide the two yeah but is this every change correct because
26:57 uh can't be 0.2 no 0.3 so today again we can be they sold
27:04 one item after it's 15 days actually yeah which can be yeah
27:10 yeah correct correct it is possible now we want to compute
27:16 average is divided by average open stuff average sales divided by
27:22 so lifestyles are all the decimal so you want open Stock divided let me just take one of those if you are if you want to
27:28 do that let's take uh uh if if 10 if 9 will say
27:35 let's go look at F9 F9 see they sold two one three yeah
27:42 actually two one three three two one two two but six actually there's a simpler way of doing this now let's just look at
27:48 sales data and what do we want F9 let me filter this
27:58 is by D if you want the overall sales total sales no we want sales for matters
28:04 but by day yes so I will do
28:15 so for Mattress which SQ F 0 9
28:21 foreign
28:53 open Stock by and again I'll reduce the on decimal is
29:01 good yeah
29:06 okay drag it
29:12 all right so the fashion Goods 4.6 6.55 but they're all looking okay F9 57 okay
29:19 so GV uh We've looked at average sales we've looked at average open Stock now
29:25 we have a picture of uh average days of inventory yeah I think we just need to
29:31 find a decent way of representing this uh in ah in some form of graphical
29:40 I'm surprised that the l01 we have only one day of humanity
29:46 you should probably ask omkar about this in fact if you see a lot of the ills
29:52 have a very little inventory so some of them say l06 l l o seven is 42 days it's
29:57 okay yes let's go down and see what is the other situation see some of 0.8.7 or M my God what's going on
30:10 m is a serious problem m is a serious problem actually if you see no the first
30:16 six see you know when we did that first opening stock by we didn't get this picture at all correct that is true
30:22 isn't it is true so that is the reason why we need to do this very very true very true
30:27 and actually in many of these no in both in lifestyle you will see that some have
30:35 very low inventory and some are very high very high same way in phones also
30:41 l09 173 okay I don't know that makes no sense at all yeah basically it means
30:47 that they have some product and it's not selling at all that's right yes they have inventory and it's not selling it you should do some what you call it the
30:53 clearance sale correct something like that you should get rid of it and go up and see what you got if F okay
30:59 that's f is all right F I think should be all right f is f is already if looks okay yeah
31:05 it looks okay yeah no we should definitely discuss this L see M actually
31:10 we had some inkling right because we knew that yeah yeah but L also something is happening we should discuss with
31:17 omkar um so I was thinking maybe they've been
31:22 depict it in some form of uh diagrammatically yes so there is an you
31:29 have three I mean unfortunately okay we have three things to represent no we have so X and Y will be this X and Y can
31:35 be open Stock average sales average sales and uh how do you represent the average is I think let me just see this
31:43 uh there's a bubble chart okay let's just take
31:53 if you want to take I'll just take the F's because we saw one one thing we saw GB is
32:01 any of these caterpillars let's just look at you need to have only 10 elements or something if you have too
32:06 many Ah that's okay what is that what you had earlier no it's anyway taking
32:13 okay what is it saying oh it's picked different colors for the
32:19 different F's it's baked we don't need different
32:26 colors for different types did you choose the F also you don't use f
32:32 you don't want me to choose f yes don't use the first for any column and see what happens
32:41 because that it is let's see
32:50 yeah that's better right yeah okay so what is it doing now it's saying
32:58 basically okay so what have we plotted but what is the size and what is the what is X and Y out
33:04 to choose X and minor so no let me label this then we can do something better so this is
33:24 let me how do I insert a chart design add chart element
33:31 we will add access title so primary vertical is what this is
33:39 vertical is or days of sales but has it taken that we don't know
33:47 it may not have taken that it has a yeah it does okay it is
33:53 so yeah
33:60 and horizontal it has taken data series one
34:07 average opens hold on let me do one thing
34:19 select data
34:24 add yeah FM CG
34:30 X values are from here always better to do this
34:36 because you don't know what it's doing for what character yeah X values are this y values are sales
34:50 yeah yeah and bubble size is
35:14 okay yeah yeah this is bad this looks good yeah this looks good yeah yeah and now uh let
35:22 me add a title so access title is
35:40 okay this is what this is uh average daily sales no no this is
35:48 average opening stock average
35:54 open stock add chart element
36:06 average I think it's not writing it there so I'm
36:11 very editing yeah okay
36:16 average daily so what do students can do gve perhaps
36:22 is create similar charts for lifestyle and mobile well yeah yeah and I think
36:28 there will be some interesting things to see in the mobile case it looks like a lot of them are in trouble isn't it yeah yeah
36:34 you'll get dots yes the resource small you will get correct correct the bubbles
36:39 will almost be dots huh yeah I think should be a nice exercise
36:44 to do okay I think we have enough material to show to um I think so yeah
36:51 okay
