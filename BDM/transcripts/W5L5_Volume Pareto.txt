00:00 foreign
00:03 [Music]
00:28 so let's look at volumes so the data I
00:31 guess that we have to use this the sheet
00:33 which is selling the sales by day
00:47 but now it's got every so we got
00:50 so we have to add up yes we have to add
00:53 up the sales so if you want to find out
00:54 the sales of m01 then one thing we can
00:57 do is we can do a filter
00:58 right so you can just simply select
01:08 give us all the m0 ones now you add this
01:11 up
01:14 it's a pain to do I know it's it's pain
01:16 no huh see yeah so we're adding up
01:18 across all the all the cities all the
01:21 dates all the dates nine zero nine
01:25 total sum is 90. yeah and there's no
01:29 systematic way of doing this no we need
01:32 to so is there I mean some Excel would
01:34 have something there is a tool in Excel
01:36 it's called pivot table
01:38 okay
01:40 so what the pivot table allows us to do
01:42 is to basically look at various cuts of
01:45 the data okay on different axis so in
01:48 this case you want it on the m01 sort of
01:51 axis right if you look at the data as a
01:54 as a you know x y z graph and you want
01:58 to say what is the data that is there in
01:60 this one plane m01 m01 plane that's
02:03 really what pivot tables hopefully will
02:06 do correct so here is what we do we
02:08 select this entire data so now what we
02:12 do is we go and we say insert pivot
02:15 table now what we want and let's let's
02:18 try and imagine what what is the table
02:20 we want right the table we want is that
02:23 in the we want rows made of skus so
02:27 you've got a table in which the rows are
02:29 M 0 1 M 0 to m03 m04
02:33 and against each SKU you have the sum of
02:36 all the units that were sold over 15
02:39 days over 15 days across all cities
02:41 across all cities right yeah so the
02:43 first thing you do is you take
02:45 this SKU column and you move it into
02:50 this
02:50 thing called
02:52 rows
02:53 okay okay so now you can see that you
02:56 have got a table which has 30 rows and
03:02 the rows are row labels are basically
03:04 your SK units all right understand
03:07 now the second thing you should do is
03:10 you want to know what are the values
03:11 associated with each of these
03:14 so you look at
03:16 the data correspond in in column cell
03:20 and you move it to Sigma values
03:24 oh so now this is giving you some of
03:27 sale
03:29 we can do other things also you can do
03:31 other things also so you could do as an
03:33 example it's okay so if you look at this
03:37 so if you click on this yeah it will
03:40 give you a menu one of the fields there
03:43 will be value field settings okay so if
03:45 you click on value field settings
03:47 instead of count instead of sum I could
03:50 say count oh I see so it will tell you
03:53 that there are 45 45 entries for f01
03:57 which is not a surprise 15 days three
03:59 distribution centers right so everywhere
04:01 you will see 45 entries I think
04:04 but maybe we will let us look at some
04:08 more interesting right so instead of uh
04:11 same access let's look at Max yeah
04:15 so the highest sale of f 0 1
04:19 in a single day from a single DC was 34
04:23 units
04:25 36 is also there 36 for M 0 for f01 f 0
04:29 1 was 34 for f 0 1 it was 34. okay okay
04:32 for uh L 0 1 it was 36 right right
04:36 okay but actually what we want right now
04:40 is sum we want some right so let's
04:42 select some Okay so
04:45 and just to cross check our work do you
04:48 remember yeah nine zero nine
04:51 nine zero nine so m01 is 90. okay
04:56 so because I have not selected date or
04:60 city
05:01 the those values are ignored it seems to
05:05 have listed this in alphabetical order
05:06 okay it will list it on alphabets
05:09 alphabetical order of the SQL names
05:13 but actually that is not interesting to
05:15 us what we want it in and omkar's
05:19 question was which is giving the highest
05:22 volume
05:23 so you actually want it sorted on some
05:25 of sale you don't want it sorted on
05:28 alphabetical order no you can sort it
05:30 the only thing is uh pivot tables will
05:35 not allow you to sort on a computed
05:37 column
05:38 what is a computer so this is a computed
05:40 column because if you look at this it
05:43 says Sigma value so we computed sum of
05:46 sales okay okay now if you want to sort
05:48 on a computed column what you do is you
05:52 take this table
05:54 Let's ignore the grand total value and
05:57 you
05:58 copy the values in this table Ctrl C
06:01 Ctrl C
06:02 and then in another
06:05 place in the sheet you paste it as
06:09 values
06:11 so now this is not a computed value this
06:14 is an absolute value okay okay
06:16 this table now you can sort
06:21 okay okay
06:23 so we can sort on and you want this
06:26 sorted on
06:28 sorry I should have I should have
06:30 collected
06:32 so
06:38 so now if I say sort
06:42 I want it sorted by some of sales and I
06:46 wonder
06:46 highest values first ah okay yes yeah so
06:50 I want largest to smallest largest to
06:52 smallest yes is any order correct so
06:55 this tells you that F 0 1
06:58 you make you sold 914 units across the
07:02 three distribution centers in 15 days
07:06 m01 mobile kilometer second highest with
07:09 12 000 rupees or something like that and
07:12 this was the one if you remember the CFO
07:14 wanted to know why are you not getting
07:16 something it is generating most of their
07:17 revenue looks like correct we'll find
07:19 out 22 Revenue but yeah looks like that
07:21 okay so we know that nine okay so now
07:24 what so what it is what do you want to
07:26 know you want to find out which ones are
07:28 so so this gives the sick some number
07:30 three you can take phones five take the
07:33 top five top five how much uh how many
07:36 units do the top five skus sell is that
07:39 your because we said we want to find the
07:41 units which are selling the most correct
07:43 so here take some number of these take
07:45 the first five okay so we will take
07:47 first five but actually that doesn't
07:49 make sense no because you take C fixed
07:51 what is it one two three four five four
07:53 fifty Seven sixth one is 429 actually
07:55 it's quite nearby
07:57 on what basis you will take five you can
07:59 take 10 hours yeah
08:01 three
08:10 and say first three
08:13 uh the other way of doing a GB is to
08:17 let's see totally how many shipments did
08:20 this did they do
08:22 all together all together okay
08:25 so if I
08:27 go here
08:29 that is that 7438 we have on the left
08:32 yeah seven four three eight right
08:46 okay now the question is
08:50 how important is 9 14 and 7438
08:54 it's quite important I would suspect 914
08:57 as a percentage of sample correct
08:59 do that now we can do that
09:02 No 9 14.
09:04 here we can say this
09:08 divided by
09:15 12 so let me just a prism is important
09:19 10 is a lot it is no yeah
09:25 what is that after the river
09:27 I'm just trying to say that I will
09:29 divide everything by the sum
09:35 and if I
09:37 show it as a percentage it's 12 percent
09:42 now if I do the same thing for all
09:45 so you will see that the top three are
09:48 roughly contributing to 12 percent each
09:50 of the deliveries
09:52 then there is a bunch of them that are
09:54 contributing roughly between six and
09:56 three percent and then actually there is
09:58 no Trend now it's like
09:60 it looks I mean
10:03 there is this principle called Pareto
10:06 Principle okay
10:08 ah Pareto Principle says that ah
10:12 in any I mean any naturally occurring
10:15 thing
10:16 eighty percent of the things will be
10:18 done by 20 20 80 percent of the things
10:21 will be contributed by 20 of the causes
10:25 yeah okay always usually usually
10:28 usually the most naturally occurring
10:30 things
10:31 so if you are selling for example 80
10:33 percent of the sales will be from 20 of
10:35 the products so in this case
10:37 of the volumes will come from 20 percent
10:40 of the skills you know volume is I don't
10:42 know that's happening it surely when we
10:44 see Revenue you might see it but the
10:46 usually 80 80 yeah generally it's like
10:50 that
10:53 and see yeah we can add we can add that
10:56 and see so what we're doing is
10:58 cumulating right adding we will need to
11:00 accumulate no so we will because you
11:02 want to see what you are saying is
11:04 totally you can compute the percentage
11:06 at the percentages
11:08 I can add the volumes I think okay
11:12 yeah okay now so the first unit the
11:18 topmost unit was contributing 914
11:21 deliveries
11:23 for the two the first two units are
11:26 contributing
11:28 914 plus 909 plus 909 yeah
11:34 now first three the first three are
11:36 contributing eighteen twenty three plus
11:38 eight Ninety Six ah correct correct let
11:41 me keep going so now if I double click
11:43 that you get all the way yeah okay
11:45 that's good yeah
11:47 and this you are saying I can do a
11:49 percentage percentage of the total
11:50 percentage of the total okay let's do
11:53 that
11:54 this we could have done the percentage
11:55 and add it also we could have actually
11:58 but now when I click okay let's see
12:01 what's going on let's see we're getting
12:02 to 80 18 is so let's say here right
12:07 roughly here
12:08 is 80. this is like 15 seconds there's
12:12 no use no it doesn't seem half the items
12:14 are contributed so this is not showing
12:16 anything no no it's not half it's about
12:18 11. base 11. see you're beginning on row
12:22 four or row four and up to row 15. so
12:26 roughly 11 items are contributing 80 so
12:30 11 out of 30 would be about forty
12:32 percent forty percent forty percent is
12:34 contributing 80. something somewhat
12:37 close to I mean but it's not really we
12:38 should see 20 but six items six to seven
12:41 items that is what the rules yeah the
12:44 principal was saying saying should
12:45 should be like that it should be like
12:47 generally if you have a shop can a large
12:49 shop correct because I think maybe
12:51 because we have 30 items but if you have
12:52 a large number of items this is what you
12:54 will see a few items will be
12:56 contributing to majority of the sales in
12:57 terms of uh volume volume or Revenue
12:60 both Revenue both cases okay okay ok ok
13:03 so in this case the parallel rule is
13:06 should we then for the same way GV then
13:09 let's look at because anyway omkar was
13:11 asking us for Revenue also so in this
13:14 case can we say that the F 0 1 M 0 1 and
13:17 l01 those are the three items looks like
13:19 no kind of because they are dominant
13:21 dominant items a third of uh your sales
13:24 are coming just from 10 of your uh
13:26 something like that escapes something
13:28 like that yeah yeah ten percent equal to
13:30 Big third yeah ten percent is
13:32 contributing a third okay but then let's
13:35 go and see uh omkar was asking us anyway
13:38 for Revenue also which are the skus that
13:41 are contributing to revenue so why don't
13:43 we repeat this analysis for Revenue we
13:45 should do that
