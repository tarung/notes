00:00 So, I think we got a sense of 
this addressable market thing,   some kind of method. Some picture at least. 
Picture we got. Now, the question really is that,   of course, while we did that, we did it out of 
hunch right off, some general top down thing.  
00:20 But a good way to do it is not this top 
down, which is to start from the top, but  
00:36 kind of allow the information 
to flow from the bottom. So,   if you have data and we have data, we 
have to look at the data and start to make  
00:45 sense out of it, keeping in mind the fact 
that we are trying to solve this problem. Which problem? Trying to find how 
many people will buy 2 wheels,  
00:50 not only that, how many people 
will take load to buy 2 wheels.   So, that problem is there in the mind. While that 
is in the mind, we are not being influenced by  
00:59 that problem overly. We are just staring at 
the data and trying to make sense out of it. And trying to interpret what is coming from 
the data. So, I guess the sheet we have to  
01:10 look at aspirational data set. I guess. We have 
not looked at that data set. No, we have not. We have not. We spend some time on the other 
one. Not much on this. So, shall we look at  
01:20 that data set, aspirational data set? It says 
something. It says, are you going to buy? This is,  
01:28 these, we had done earlier, we had done this. We tried to compare. We had looked at the fields 
that are available. So, are you going to buy a  
01:39 2-wheeler? It is asked specifically in that. It 
is asked specifically. So, one thing to do is.
01:44 It is asked, actually they have 
a second question. This is,  
01:50 they have three interesting questions. 
Let us just look for 2-wheelers. So,  
01:59 they are, the first thing they have asked is, how 
many 2-wheelers you own? So, can we just simply  
02:07 look at how many people are saying they want to 
buy 2-wheelers, intend to buy. Let us do that.
02:13 And as a percentage of the population and see 
the split of that by some. So, but even that we  
02:21 have more information. Will buy 2-wheeler, will 
buy 2-wheeler of type and will buy 2-wheeler now  
02:30 and is this a good time to buy 2-wheeler? We 
have a lot more color on it. Let us start with   just will buy 2-wheeler. I presume we will first 
say will buy 2-wheeler and then only the others.
02:41 So, let us start with that. So, 
first let us count how many people   want to buy 2-wheeler as a percentage of the 
population. So, we had 100 samples in this.  
02:51 How many have 2-wheelers, let us 
specify that dot. Good, good question. You are doing by filtering. I am doing it by 
filtering. Let me remove all filters first.  
03:05 And then we will. Oh, there is a minus 99. This one we have not done the minus 
99. I will just do that quickly.  
03:11 Replace minus 99 with blank. Replace.
03:18 Minus 99. Oh, sorry.  
03:31 Done. Now, what do you want? We want 
to see how many people have. So,  
03:38 let us remove the blank. Some people have 2. Looks like. How many people have 2? Let  
03:47 me. 2-wheelers. So, there are 2 out 
of 100 have 2 2-wheelers. That is  
03:52 believable. Let us say there is a young 
couple, husband and wife, both of them. They do not ask them. They do not ask them. 
Maybe one scooter, one motorcycle. Could be.  
04:02 They did not ask like that. See, actually they have asked, if you 
see, but. It says 2. Does it have a.  
04:12 It does not have multiple fields. If you 
have 2 2-wheelers, then you want to know. Anyway, whatever. This 2, area 2 data set 
is very small. So I will pick 0, 1 and 2.  
04:26 We will remove the blanks. So, we now know that 
there are how many? So, 62 people have answered.
04:36 Responded. 62 responded. 
62 responded. Out of that,  
04:41 we will remove the 0s. So out 
of 62, 46 own a 2-wheeler.  
04:51 We saw that actually when we were doing that 
other analysis. 46 out of 62 own a 2-wheeler. 70 percent, they said. Yeah. 70 percent already. 
Roughly. Roughly. Very high penetration already.
05:05 Correct. I do not think this represents 
the reality in India, but anyway.  
05:10 I do not think 70 percent of households 
are 2-wheelers. Do you mean? 70 percent of   households may be having 2-wheelers. I do not 
think. 70 percent of people may not be having.
05:20 70 percent of households. That many 
2-wheelers are there. So, if on average,   1 person, 1 household has 4 people, then you 
are saying 1 in 28 people. 35 crore households.
05:33 35 crore households. 35 crore. Car 70 percent. 
70 percent will be like 25 crores. 25 crores,  
05:42 scooters. Install base. How can I? If you are 
selling a crore and a half 2-wheelers a year.
05:49 For 25 years. But it is okay. Okay.
05:55 All right. Maybe. Maybe. Okay. Looks like a 
lot. Okay. I thought there were a lot of poor  
06:03 people in India. Poor households are supposed to 
be. I think affordability is, affordability is.
06:09 Middle class percentage is only 
35 percent or something like that.   But I think a 2-wheeler can be afforded by 
somebody who is not entirely middle class.  
06:19 Because people will go and buy second 
hand. So, because of second hand, no? Okay.
06:27 Possible. I know people, I know painters as an 
example who own 2-wheelers. But urban, yeah.
06:34 Urban. Yeah, yeah, urban. Fair. All right. 
Maybe. Okay. We do not know. It looks,  
06:41 okay, if that is the number, that is the number. We will just go with that. So, we 
have, see this is the thing about data,   right? You have to just believe it. 
Correct. Right? Correct. You cannot  
06:49 question it. You start questioning 
it, then you cannot go in there. No. No. So. So, the other thing we know is, 
have they bought a 2-wheeler in the recent past,  
06:59 last 6 months? We know that. We know that. Okay. 
How many bought in the last 6 months? Out of this  
07:06 46. How many bought in last 6 months? Out of the 
46, maybe 5 have bought in the last 6 months.
07:15 So, they have new 2-wheelers. So 5 out of 46 means 
1 by 9. 1 by 9, 1 by 10. So, about 10 percent of  
07:22 the install base either has been, has bought 
the 2-wheeler now or they bought another one.
07:27 Yeah. Or they replaced it. Correct. Or they 
bought a second hand actually. We do not   know what. We do not know how the question 
was worded. But it is a way to think about  
07:36 it. If you have an existing market of, 
we wrote it in our addressable market.
07:41 If you have an addressable, if you have a market 
which is of 2-wheelers that is there, 10 percent  
07:46 of that you can assume are people who will 
replace their 2-wheelers or something. Correct. Correct. Something like that you can. Correct. 
The other way to look at it is if 10 percent of  
07:57 the people have bought in the last 6 months or 
1 year whatever, you forecast it in the future,  
08:04 maybe another 10 percent will replace. Something 
like that. It makes sense because you do not keep  
08:11 a 2-wheeler for too long. Correct. Car on average 
about 7 years after that it starts to give up.
08:16 Yes. After 10 years you 
kind of have to replace it.   Maintenance cost becomes too high. Correct. 
2-wheeler also similar. Correct. Of course,  
08:22 I know people who have kept 
2-wheelers for more than that. Yeah. 10, 12, 15 years. Yeah. On average 
I think 6, 7 years. Correct. 10 percent  
08:34 is a very reasonable I think. So, what is 
also makes sense TV is the guys who have   bought recently are saying they will not buy a 
2-wheeler obviously because they have just bought.
08:44 Correct, correct, correct, correct, correct, 
correct. But what we really want is these guys,  
08:49 people who have answered yes to the 
question will buy 2-wheeler. Yes,   yes. So, let us remove this 
filter and filter here.
09:01 Out of the 46. 46 people who have 2-wheelers. 
Oh, 46 people who have 2-wheelers. 2 people  
09:09 are saying they will buy 2-wheeler again. 
Correct, which could be either replacement  
09:14 or it could be a second 2-wheeler. No, no, no. So, this yeah, it could be yeah. So, 
what are we saying now? Out of 46, out of 46,  
09:22 6 people, 6 know. 6 bought recently. Out of 
46 or 60 something, no 62 total size, 46.
09:31 62 total size, this is 46. 
Out of 46, 6 bought recently.  
09:36 And 2 are saying they will buy. 
They will buy again. Again.   Out of the 46, 6 remove, 40 is there, out of the 
40, 2 more are saying they will buy a replacement.
09:45 Correct. Either replacement or a second. 
Alright. The 6 guys basically may have  
09:52 bought it new. For the first time buyers 
may have. First time buyers. Correct. Then? Now, let us look at the people who do 
not have 2-wheelers. Because they are likely  
10:03 to be our primary market. They are the ones, yeah, 
they do not have 2-wheelers. They are the first,   first thing you should bought. So, here 
you can see that about 18 people out of 62.
10:12 So, 44 plus 18 is 62. 62. So, 18. So, 
18. Out of 62. Do not have 2-wheelers.  
10:22 Do not have 2-wheelers. How many of 
them are interested in buying? 18. So, that we can see will buy.  
10:31 Oh man, quite a few. So, 9 out of 
18. 9. So, 50 percent. 50 percent.  
10:39 Now, we saw that penetration 
itself is like 60 percent. After the remaining 50 percent, we need to 
buy. It may not be now. Are you going to  
10:46 buy now? Good time to buy. What does it buy now? Good time to. We will 
buy. Okay. Okay. That is what you should see.  
10:54 This is what we will buy now. So, out of those 9,   7 are saying they will buy now. And is it a good 
time to buy? Actually, people who are saying,  
11:09 what are 7? Only 3 are saying. So, at least 
4 people are saying it is not a good time to  
11:14 buy a 2-wheeler, but I still have to buy 
because I may be needing it for my job.
11:20 For work. Or you know, the guy 
could be driving for swiggy.  
11:28 So, 62, so okay, 62 total people have responded of 
which 18 are saying they do not have 2-wheelers.  
11:35 After 18, 9 are saying they want to buy. Let us write this down. We have to. Yes, 
this picture let us write down. Draw the  
11:43 picture up. So, what did we say? So, 
what did we say? Total respondents 62.
11:56 62. Of which,  
12:05 let me do this.  
12:13 Do not have 2-wheeler, 18.
12:20 Of which,   want to buy, want to buy. 9. Not 9, 7. 9, 9. Not 
a good time to buy 7. No, no, will buy now is,  
12:41 this is will buy now, will buy, will buy now.
12:46 7. Will buy now is 7. 7. 7 will buy now. So, 
which is, as a percentage 7 by 18, 18 for about  
12:57 40 percent will buy now. Of those who do not have 
2-wheelers, 40 percent will buy now. Correct.
13:05 It is good information. And have 2-wheeler  
13:16 is how much? 44 of which want to buy now. 
Correct, correct. Two of them want to buy.
13:25 Of that. Now, there I do not know whether we 
looked at want to buy now. So, let us do that.  
13:34 So, cars only.  
13:42 Here, this is.
13:49 It is not mutually exclusive, car and 2-wheeler   ownership. No. We will check that. 
No, probably not. So, out of this,  
14:02 this is 44, no? This is 44.
14:07 Now, what do we want? Will buy now. 
Will buy now. This is will buy now,  
14:22 no? 2 out of 44. 2 out of 44 will buy now. So,   you have to add those two 
numbers in some sense to get.
14:29 Correct, correct. So, we got 2 from here 
and 7 from there. So, if I copy this.  
14:39 So, can we, this is a good way to 
depict this kind of thing is 2 by 2.  
14:45 So, on one axis you show people who are having 
2-wheelers, people not having 2-wheelers.  
14:54 So, this 2 by 2, management 
made 2 by 2 is a big thing.   Everything has to be depicted by 2 by 2 because 
it is easy to visualize, easy to understand.
15:02 So, you have, do not have, do not own,  
15:12 own. That is the one direction. 
The other direction you have,   will buy, want buy, will buy. Want 
buy, will buy. So, you got a 2 by 2.
15:25 Do not own is how much? Do not own and will 
not buy. Do not own and will not buy. Do not  
15:31 own. Do not own is 18. Out of 18, 9 are 
saying, 7 are saying, will not buy now.
15:40 We will interpret this as will not buy now.  
15:46 Will buy now. Correct? So, 18 minus, this is 
11. 42. And this is 7. This is 7. That is 42.
16:02 This is 2 and this is 42. So, this is the total, 
you start up, the whole thing must come to 62. 62.  
16:12 Yes, correct. 62. So, this split 
of 62 into 4 boxes goes like this.
16:18 This is a very good way of showing. Actually, 
it is very clear. Very clear. Very clear. Now,   this 7 plus 2, 9 is the total number that. And the  
16:26 ones that we want to go after are these. 
Correct. But the mechanism of selling  
16:35 to these guys versus the mechanism of 
selling to these guys may be different. Different. Two out of. Also, the kind of vehicles  
16:43 these guys will buy. Because they will 
probably be more informed about together. Kind of, yes. You will have to upgrade 
them. Is not it? Maybe you have to buy back.  
16:51 Something. Upgrade, buy back. Correct. 
You give them some offer, you give them. Or, you know, my first vehicle was a 
100cc. Now, I am aspiring to a 200cc. So,  
17:02 you should ask actually in your 
survey question, you should ask,   if you own a motorcycle, what is the 
category of motorcycle you have? You would  
17:08 like to buy. And what is it you would like 
to buy? That you have to ask. Is not it? Yes.
17:13 And you have to finance him for in a way that   basically you will get his 
putter rail back. Correct. Give him a new one. Correct. For the delta,  
17:20 you give him a finance and all that. Correct. 
Car guys do it very well. I do not know whether   two-wheeler guys do it that way. Car guys 
do it very well. Car guys do it very well.  
17:30 But for this guy, who does not own but will 
buy now, the mechanism may be very different.
17:37 There it may be just pure financing. Financing, he 
may not know much about two-wheelers. He left to  
17:44 do education. You tell him about two-wheelers, 
my age, that. Motorcycle has more mileage.
17:50 Motorcycle is not so family friendly or whatever. 
Scooter is very family friendly. Can carry  
17:55 your stuff. You can lift things, you put things 
inside. So, many things are beneficial in scooter. Child can stand in the front. 
Big family can sit there.  
18:05 It is easy to push around. It is not heavy. Those 
kind of benefits. But the guy who already has to  
18:10 let go of all that. No point in telling him all 
that. No sir, but the fact that he by just by  
18:15 putting it in this sort of a box, you can now have 
some of these conversations is very interesting. Very interesting. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Very 
nice. So, what I like next to do basically  
18:27 is to understand this two by two itself, 
but going down a little further. Sure.  
18:34 Can we generally looking at the whole population,   can we now look at it from the lens of urban 
and rural? Is there some, so if I do urban.
18:41 What do you like to do? If I just take urban. Let 
me. And do the same questions, same two by two I  
18:47 want to do. Let us see here. So, what do you want? 
You want me to first filter on urban is it? Yeah,  
18:52 is the same picture appearing or is it slightly 
different picture in urban? So, now the same thing  
19:29 you want to draw, no? Same picture I want to make. So, this is all. All. Yeah. Now, I will just 
copy this and say urban. Yeah. And we will   clear this out. Yeah, you can do a similar 
one for rural. Yeah, I might as well.
19:38 Just have to subtract that from this, so you 
do not have to do it again. Yeah. Just have  
19:44 to subtract one from the other. So, now I have 
filtered on urban. So, first what is the first  
19:53 thing that we. How many people have two wheelers 
and how many people do not have two wheelers?   Out of the people who have two wheelers how many 
want to buy now? First let us remove the blanks.
20:02 So, if I remove the blanks. That will 
be 62. No, it will not be enough. It will be 45. 45, let us keep that in 
mind. Total is 45. So, out of the 45. Oh,  
20:13 45 urban. 45 urban. I see. Sample is skewed. 
Well. I thought more people are in rural.
20:22 More urban people have responded to the survey. 
Aspirational survey they want to do more urban.
20:29 Maybe. So, 31 out of. 45 have two wheelers.
20:35 So, 45, so let 45 which? 45. 
31 out of 45 people have to do   more urban. 45. 45. 45. 
45. 45. 45. 45. 45. 45. 45. 45. 45. 45. 45. 45. 45. So, 31 
out of 45 have two wheelers. So,  
20:44 what are we saying? We cannot write anything yet. We have to do one more. No, no. We 
know, no. The sum of that is 31.
20:50 That is how we know. Oh, okay, 
okay. And now? We want to buy now.  
20:58 We will buy now. We will buy now. Yes, 
sir. We will buy now. Nobody. In urban,  
21:05 people who have two wheelers do not 
want to buy a second two wheeler. So, all the 31. Let us write. Put it in 
the box. We can put it in the box. 0.
21:13 So, you see, 2 wheeler. This 
gives us some real insight.   So, urban people who own is 31. 0. 0. 
Now, let us go to people who do not own.
21:30 Do not own. How many do not own? 14 
do not own. Out of those 14. How many  
21:51 will buy now? 7 will buy. It is a lot. 7 out of 14 will buy. 
But it is the same. No, what is it?  
22:02 No, it is less. Do not own 7. 7. So, 
half, whereas where it was 7 and 11 all.
22:12 Correct. So, not subtract. I think this is 
giving some picture about urban and rural.   So, this is. Urban seems to 
be more. 4. Iffy about buying.
22:20 0. 11. 2. So, these rural people who do not own. 
Is that correct, by the way? Let me check. Rural  
22:32 people who do not own are not going to buy. 
Looks like. Because they do not have money.   So, probably what has happened is there 
has been a good crop and the people  
22:41 who have made money are probably 
looking to buy a second one maybe. Maybe there are people who are rich can afford,  
22:48 poor people cannot afford. 
Divide is much higher. Correct.  
22:54 So, you see there are only two people from rural 
areas who are interested in buying two will have. So, you should only concentrate 
as selling to urban areas. Maybe.  
23:04 Maybe. Sad way of looking at it, but yeah. 
Yeah. And even if you are going to rural areas,   go to people who already have 
two will have to sell to them.
23:13 Correct. Do not be able to 
others. Correct. In urban   area on the other hand, you will 
target the guys who do not own.
23:18 Yes. Because seven of them you 
are going to sell. Yes. Yes.   This is really insightful. 
This is very insightful.
23:25 Very insightful. It is telling you a lot about 
strategy. Yes. Now you will go about it. Yes.  
23:31 Maybe I should just make this bold because this 
analysis has to be clear. Urban and then rural  
23:38 also you can write. Yeah. Yeah. So, you can 
write that sell only to, sell only to urban  
23:55 market in rural only those who have, target 
only those who already have two will.
24:03 See, the point is if they already have two 
willers, they will be coming for maintenance   and all. Correct. Correct. Yes. They 
have service station will be there.
24:10 And that is the way to reach them. When they come,   you try to push another two willers to 
there. In urban markets. Like that. Target  
24:21 those who do not own. Do not have to be less.
24:28 This is our recommendation. This 
is our recommendation based on   the results. And what would be really nice 
GV is if, when students do their project.
24:37 Project. They can do something. They could come   up with some recommendations 
like this. Similar to this. Yeah. That would be interesting. 
That would be really nice. Really,  
24:46 really nice. Really nice. Is not it? Yes, 
yes. This is just as example recommendation.  
24:60 Right? Yeah.  
25:05 Okay. So, I think this is, this is very cool,   man. Now one more thing, one 
thing we have not looked at all.
25:13 There are, we saw that there are three categories 
of, there is scooters, there are some cheaper  
25:20 motorcycles and there are heavy 250- Correct. 
100cc motorcycles. Correct. Big motorcycles. Big motorcycles. How many are, how 
many people out of the people who own,  
25:28 how many people own which category? That is 
one piece of information. Okay. We can try   and figure that out. And second is out 
of the buying intention, what are they  
25:37 saying? I want to understand whether there is 
a general trend towards bigger motorcycles. See in cars, this is clearly the 
case. Yes. Lower end cars are  
25:45 going out of fashion. People want 
to buy SUVs. Yes. Is not it? Yes.  
25:50 What is happening in motorcycles? Are 
people trying to migrate towards? Sure. Let us see. So, these are the people who own two 
wheelers. Now, out of that, let us first see.  
26:08 So, there are totally 62, right, 
wherever 62 wheelers, right.
26:13 So, we will do the whole this thing now.  
26:23 Data, advanced, copy.  
26:33 Why are we doing it? The only three categories. 
Yeah, but might as well automate it, no.  
26:38 Makes life easier for us. I say you 
want to count. Just count it, count it. Sure, find it.  
26:58 Some blanks also came, we will remove this. 
In general, I think this is the right way to  
27:05 do it because you may actually miss 
a category if you are not careful. Especially, we have only 100, but if you 
have 10,000 rows. Now, we want to have  
27:17 market share. Market share, correct. Market 
share of existing owners, that is what is it.
27:26 Of existing owners. Yeah, market share 
is of existing owners. So, this is count  
27:51 if.  
28:06 So, this I should say dollar, dollar.  
28:28 So, let us now see sum 62. What happened?  
28:44 C4 to C6 it should be. 44. Because it is 
why Urban? Because 18 people do not own.
29:03 This divided by $C$7.  
29:25 Now, so what are we saying? We are saying 
that the big bikes is only 5 percent.  
29:35 No, the small bikes is 5 percent. Which is the 
big one? Apache is the big bike. Apache is the  
29:41 big bike. So, big bike is 5 percent. 32 percent 
is scooters and 64 percent is small bikes.
29:49 No, no, 64 percent is scooters, active 
owner is scooters. Oh, sorry, sorry,   64 percent is scooters, 32 percent 
is small bikes and 5 percent is big  
29:58 bikes. That is correct. I think 
that is very true. Intuitively. But I want to understand the people from 
going forward are moving from scooter to  
30:03 bikes. Let us ask. And whether they 
are going from bikes to bigger bikes.  
30:13 Here we do not need to do buy now or not. Just look at intent to buy only. Not now, 
we are not interested in the buy now part.  
30:20 So, we will say count if. Here we look at 
a different column. This is the column.  
30:32 BU2 to BU101. But you want to do it 
only if that guy is Bajaj whatever.
30:44 That is what you are doing.   Oh, right, right, right. I 
understand what you are doing.  
30:53 Correct, no? Count if S, no? There is nothing 
count if S, no? No, no. Do you want to count if S?  
30:59 Because you want to count the number of 
people who have Bajaj city and will say yes.
31:05 So, I am saying that the fact that, 
so let me explain to you my logic.  
31:17 This is what type of to be  
31:24 there. Oh, there also there is 
a type of to be there. Yeah,  
31:29 will buy two wheeler of type. And the 
fact that this Bajaj city is there,   I am assuming means that he has 
already answered yes to will buy.
31:36 Oh, right, right, right. Got it, got it, got it. 
I did not know that there was, I did not know that   the type was there in that. Yeah, yeah, very nice. 
That is good, very good. Saves a lot of trouble.  
31:48 This is what, this is 11 people. 11 people are saying they will buy, but I 
think some of them are saying will not buy  
31:56 now. That is why that two people are saying. So, 
what is the ratio now? Just take the percentage.
32:04 Same percentage. Similar, no? Do it, do it.  
32:17 You can just copy this for less. No, because 
I have used absolute. You used dollar.  
32:31 Similar, not too much change.  
32:38 Little bit change is there. So, 
55 percent. So, the intent to buy,   what is the total? The scooter is 
losing and the bigger bikes are gaining.
32:47 Bigger bikes are gaining bigly and the other 
bikes are not changing that much, 2 to 36. So,  
32:54 scooter guys are moving to bike, 
bike guys are going to bigger   bikes. Correct. That is probably what is 
happening. Possibly what is happening.
32:59 That is probably what is happening. Now, if 
I want to show this change in market share,  
33:07 how would you explain? One thing we can 
do, of course, we can do bar charts.
33:13 Chart to bar chart. Now, we 
can do stack bar charts. Yes,   we can do that. So, let us say I will do this.  
33:32 And this I do insert.  
33:43 I should not have picked this right.
33:49 What is 1, 2, 3? This is, I 
will. It is doing the other way.  
34:00 Why? It is correct. The 
stack bar chart should show.   What is it showing? This is 
the, this is 1 basically.
34:13 This it is and we will have to. I do not 
want to see the stack of 14 and 4. Then,  
34:19 okay. You want to see 14, 28, 2. That is what 
you want to do. Then what you have to do is.
34:25 I want to see 14, 28, 2 stack 
and then 4, 6. Select data,   we say switch rows to columns. 
Excel has answers for everything.
34:37 This you can remove. This we will remove.  
35:01 So, what does it say? It says. So, of course, 
these names will have to be, we will have to.  
35:10 What is 3? No, no. So, this is a data label. 
We will remove. The 2 and 1. That is this.  
35:21 See, this blue is actually this 
Bajaj city, blah, blah, blah.
35:28 So, we will have to do a little bit of formatting 
to get this. But why is it doing it like this?   Because you took number. If you have taken 
percentage and set it on a proper chart.
35:37 We should do that. Oh, you want to do 
it like that? Because otherwise you   will not see the change. Sure, sure. I understood.  
35:58 Copy that.
36:04 Yeah, you can just stack those two only. You do 
not need titles. Just take this 2 and stack it.
36:13 No, no, I just have to. Yeah, 
good. This is what I wanted to see.  
36:45 So, now you can see, what you can see? This is 
not changing much. This is red, you see. Can you  
36:51 see? Yeah. And the grey one is. We had a line 
like this. Correct. Grey one is increasing.
36:57 Actually, I think there is a thing 
that allows us to draw the line.  
37:09 Actually, we could have just done this 
instead of having to compute percentages. 100 percent stacked column would have 
given us what we wanted. I see. But I  
37:20 do not think that line thing is there. It is 
not there in Excel directly. It is there in   some of these professional things. Right. 
Okay. Okay. All right. Nice. Yeah. Okay.
