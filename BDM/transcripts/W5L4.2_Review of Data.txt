00:00 foreign
00:03 [Music]
00:26 looking at the data
00:28 the data is very rich he's given us four
00:33 uh basic sheets okay
00:35 there is a sheet that he is calling the
00:38 SKU Master huh
00:41 so the SQ master has uh five uh five
00:45 sort of columns or five items for each
00:48 SKU
00:50 first is it tells you the name of the
00:53 hko m01 m0 to F 0 3 and so on and he's
00:60 given us data I think for about 30
01:02 skills okay so 10 from M type so M 0 1
01:08 to M times 10 mobiles 10 mobile 10
01:11 mobiles
01:12 uh 10 fmcg products so it could be soap
01:16 it could be toothpaste it could be any
01:18 of these and uh 10 lifestyle products so
01:22 that could be closed it could be
01:23 lipsticks it could be you know uh vanity
01:27 products things like that
01:29 uh and he has grouped these products uh
01:33 as you if you remember he was saying
01:35 that they have three business units
01:38 called mobile fmcg and lifestyle okay my
01:42 friend yes so that's where the m f and L
01:45 in the nomenclature comes from so you've
01:47 got uh three uh three uh business units
01:51 each business unit appears to have 10
01:54 skus each okay right so you've got m one
01:56 to M ten f 1 to F ten and L one to L ten
02:01 now for each SKU he has a brand
02:05 he has a model and he has a price
02:09 so M1 which is a phone
02:12 is made by a brand called real you
02:15 um
02:17 yeah it's a synthetic name clearly the
02:21 model number is ru10
02:23 and each phone of this model sells at 12
02:27 000 rupees okay and you can see that
02:31 there is some variation in the prices
02:32 all right something is concerned this is
02:34 the one that I think the CFO was saying
02:36 saying why am why are we not getting
02:38 stocks of
02:39 say obviously something moving very high
02:42 fast possibly but sweet spot but the
02:45 supply chain is also doesn't seem to be
02:46 coming through okay so maybe there is a
02:49 shortage of chips or something right so
02:51 let's find out yeah let's see what's
02:52 happening to this yeah but it's also
02:54 interesting to see GB just take a look
02:57 at how much variation in price there is
02:59 foreign
03:09 at the other hand M10 is 60 000.
03:14 yeah there are premium phones M9 that is
03:16 fifty five thousand fifty four thousand
03:18 so there are premium phones
03:23 right entry points is eight thousand so
03:25 there's a lot of variation and so going
03:28 back to some of the questions that omkar
03:29 was asking you know uh what squs are
03:33 giving me a lot of Revenue versus what
03:36 SK us
03:38 maybe I shouldn't stock somehow correct
03:41 yeah yeah yeah yeah isn't it or I should
03:44 talk more of some of these yeah okay
03:46 okay yeah yeah
03:48 so so this is the data that he's given
03:51 us in the form of what he calls the SKU
03:54 master
03:55 and uh so I would expect basically that
03:57 uh
03:58 the high Revenue ones are m
04:00 because the numbers are very becoming
04:02 well whereas the prices are very big huh
04:06 prices are very high yes whereas the
04:08 high volume things are the fmcg ones F's
04:10 correct that would be intuitively what
04:13 we would think right because
04:15 yes uh but uh
04:19 L I don't know it will be sorry see if
04:22 we look at the frequency right
04:24 it is very possible that you buy soap
04:26 maybe once in two weeks
04:29 a shirt you may buy one only once in
04:31 three months once in six months you know
04:33 three years once in a year but a phone
04:36 you may buy only once in three years
04:38 correct correct yeah yeah so the
04:40 frequency of purchase is going to be uh
04:43 very different across the three but the
04:46 prices but the prices are also very
04:47 different okay you actually end up
04:49 spending more on so you don't know
04:50 possibly possibly
04:53 more than maybe I don't know who knows
04:55 how much is well if you look at if
04:58 you're the kind of person who buys 8 000
05:00 rupee phone
05:02 then you may actually be spending more
05:04 three years isn't it quite possible
05:07 quite possible yeah yeah
05:09 because you look at this see even if you
05:11 take the cheapest fmcg item
05:14 and I think this is some Vedic
05:17 uh what is it with the
05:20 cream cream or Vedic shampoo shampoo 290
05:24 rupees yeah 3600
05:33 yeah that's true that is true yeah yeah
05:36 very true isn't it yeah
05:38 they're comparable actually look at it
05:40 that way
05:42 okay
05:43 over an extended period of time yeah but
05:46 at that instant you are probably
05:47 spending a whole lot of money on the
05:49 phone correct and at that point you
05:51 think you're only spending 390 rupees or
05:53 290 rupees on shampoo correct right yep
05:57 but cumulatively and that is really what
05:59 fabmart is more interested in
06:01 uh possibly these spend on fmcg is
06:06 similar to the spend on phones let's
06:08 find out let's see what the data says
06:10 okay
06:11 foreign no we've only got 15 days data
06:15 but one way to look at the data one way
06:20 one will say I will look at it over
06:22 Thousand Days the other way to look at
06:24 it is I will look at what thousand
06:26 people are buying today
06:28 and you should hopefully get the same
06:30 behavior ah I say oh okay because the
06:32 volume okay volume you can make out okay
06:34 so even though you don't have Thousand
06:36 Days data you have data about thousand
06:38 people buying
06:40 okay many purchases in one small period
06:43 can give you similar Insight similar
06:45 Behavior hopefully okay okay all right
06:49 let's see the next sheet
06:53 sheets names I think omkar was referring
06:55 to these these seem to be his standard
06:58 jargon right and that that is used in
07:01 his industry the second sheet he has is
07:04 sales data
07:06 and what does the sales data tell you
07:09 the sales data tells you let's just take
07:11 this first row
07:14 ah what this sales data tells you is
07:17 that oh I think I have done some
07:19 filtering let me just remove the filter
07:21 so if you take the first row it's
07:23 telling you on first of April 2021
07:28 the mobile phone m01
07:31 sold 26 units in Hyderabad
07:35 I see
07:37 okay actually that's not correct to say
07:39 that it sold 25 units in Hyderabad
07:42 26 units of that phone were shipped from
07:46 the Hyderabad Distribution Center
07:48 I see on First on first of April okay so
07:52 now if you go down
07:54 uh you will get a movement data you're
07:56 saying basically how much is more how
07:57 much was sold sold from or shipped out
08:00 from uh
08:02 now if you go down you will see on 2nd
08:05 of April
08:07 so many units of uh
08:11 so on 2nd of April
08:13 so many units of f 0 1 which is probably
08:17 some shirt or something nine units
08:19 operation were shipped from interest
08:21 Distribution Center
08:23 okay yeah so he's given us for each day
08:27 for each City for each SKU
08:30 how many units were shipped of that SKU
08:33 from that Distribution Center hear it
08:35 yeah we know its price we can calculate
08:37 okay
08:41 sirs
08:43 opening stock
08:46 so this tells
08:47 tells on first April
08:50 2021
08:52 when I opened my warehouse at nine in
08:56 the morning
08:57 how many units were there in the
08:60 Warehouse
09:01 so what is telling each of them in each
09:03 of the warehouses so what are you saying
09:05 on first April 2021 at 9 am
09:09 I had 391 units of f01 in Hyderabad
09:12 Hyderabad is the mother so yeah correct
09:14 yeah so you just talked more
09:16 so he had 77 units in Cochin and he had
09:20 50 units of f 0 1 in Madras okay
09:24 and he's given us this data for
09:28 okay this is a static picture this is
09:32 awesome what existed on first of April
09:35 2021
09:37 at 9am
09:42 the final sheet that he has given us is
09:46 a little bit more dynamic okay okay so
09:50 what this tells you is on 1st of April
09:57 the Cochin so this is he's first of all
10:00 given us data for Cochin and Madras he
10:02 has not given us data for Hyderabad okay
10:04 okay
10:05 these are the forward BC's these are the
10:07 forward DC's so what he has told us is
10:11 that on
10:12 first of April the Cochin Distribution
10:16 Center
10:17 got 10 units of f01 where did it get
10:21 those 10 units from presumably it got
10:24 those 10 units from the Hyderabad DC
10:26 okay okay because what omkar was
10:29 explaining is that all orders to
10:32 suppliers are placed from centrally
10:35 placed so suppliers will supply to
10:39 Hyderabad Hyderabad will send it to
10:42 Chennai or to Madras or to Cochin okay
10:45 so it says first April 10 units moved
10:48 from Hyderabad to two
10:50 of f01 like that twenty one five units
10:53 of f02 yeah so it looks like there's a
10:56 truck which goes from Hyderabad to one
10:58 or many correct which go from Hyderabad
10:60 to Madras every day and in that they
11:01 pack
11:02 various various things
11:13 correct okay so this is the data that
11:19 okay
11:20 okay
11:23 this finishes that first lot of data
11:25 this one will be how many entries will
11:26 be there so like this there are 15 days
11:28 so this is
11:29 30 30 rows
11:32 and there are 15 days for each uh
11:37 forward DC so you have
11:39 for each DC so 450 per C and 450 for it
11:43 no no no
11:44 for each DC there are 15 columns and 30
11:48 rows so there are two huh so 30 no so
11:52 there are 900 Essentials 450 for each DC
11:55 450 plus 450 900 yeah totally correct
11:57 stock transfers oh my God okay the cheat
12:01 okay but what you are saying is correct
12:04 actually you should not look at it as uh
12:07 900 stock transfers probably what is
12:10 happening is one truck is going from
12:12 Hyderabad to Madras every night one
12:15 truck is going from Hyderabad to Cochin
12:17 every night and this is and what you are
12:19 seeing in one column
12:21 is what are all the items that got put
12:23 into the truck yeah that's the source of
12:27 this data probably that's must be the
12:29 source of the data correct
12:31 right yeah so 30 trucks moved 15 trucks
12:34 went from Hyderabad to Cochin 15 trucks
12:37 went from Hyderabad they only wanted one
12:39 record right in this case in this case
12:41 this this data yeah so instead of
12:43 thinking of it as 900 entries yeah you
12:45 have to think of entries for 30 trucks
12:47 yeah yeah
12:50 okay that's right yeah
12:52 okay yeah
12:54 okay so that's the data that's the data
