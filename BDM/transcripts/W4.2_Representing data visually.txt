00:18 we've now understood how to analyze data
00:20 using pivot tables
00:23 but honestly it's a little boring isn't
00:26 it looking at all of these numbers
00:29 most people
00:31 tend to lose track of data when they are
00:34 presented with large data numbers
00:37 uh instead they absorb the information
00:39 much better
00:41 if the same information is presented
00:45 visually
00:46 one of the key things that we hope you
00:49 will be able to learn out of this course
00:51 is how to not just how to analyze data
00:55 but also wherever possible present the
00:58 data with interesting visual
01:01 representations graphs uh you know and
01:05 so on
01:06 and Excel and Google Google Sheets both
01:10 give us excellent facility
01:13 to analyze uh and present data visually
01:18 so let's go back to our original data
01:21 set right a data set of students uh
01:23 their grades and their hostels
01:25 now I want I know that the spread of
01:29 students is between godavari kaveri
01:32 sarayu yamuna and Ganga
01:34 but
01:35 what does this tell me okay now I want
01:39 if I want to visually represent where
01:42 are most of the students living
01:45 how would I do that
01:47 let's just select this data so this is
01:51 the data we want to represent visually
01:55 go to insert
01:57 and look at this entire section here
02:01 is about charts okay
02:05 now what is the data we want to
02:07 represent we want to take represent
02:09 saying we have a total of 30 students
02:12 and the 30 students are broken up in
02:15 five hostels right so we want to
02:17 represent in some sense
02:20 parts of a whole right the entire class
02:23 is 30 students some of them are in
02:26 godavari some of them are in kaveri some
02:28 of them are in sarayu and so on the most
02:31 common chart that is used to represent
02:34 this is called a pie chart
02:37 so if I pick a 2d pie chart
02:41 here is what I get right so here is a
02:44 representation what am I saying the
02:47 entire circle
02:49 represents the entire class
02:53 right
02:54 and different slices of the circle you
02:57 think of this like a pizza right except
02:59 that this pizza you know when I order a
03:02 pizza from Domino's it typically comes
03:04 with six uniform slices or eight uniform
03:06 slices depending on how big the pizza is
03:09 but this pizza is not does not have
03:11 uniform slices okay the biggest slice is
03:17 godavari I think right godavari is the
03:21 biggest slice then you've got kaveri
03:24 then you've got sharayu
03:27 you've got yamuna and then ganga is
03:29 again a Big Slice right
03:32 so visually this chart allows you to get
03:36 an appreciation
03:37 of how the class is split up amongst the
03:41 five different hostels
03:42 now this chart actually is telling you
03:46 uh
03:48 some interesting things
03:50 but let's look at how to actually make
03:53 the chart a little bit more appealing
03:55 right
03:58 now one of the things that I may want to
04:00 do is to
04:03 change how
04:05 I don't want to include as an example
04:07 ganga in this
04:08 okay for whatever reason
04:14 now you see
04:15 I'm able to filter so this part here is
04:19 called a legend okay what is the legend
04:21 the legend is telling us what is the
04:24 correlation between the color
04:26 and the data that is being represented
04:30 so I the color blues deep blue stands
04:34 for let's say godavari I think
04:36 the color orange stands for kaveri gray
04:39 for sarayu yellow for yamuna and Light
04:41 Blue for Ganga
04:46 if I wanted to skip ganga for whatever
04:49 reason
04:52 then I can just filter and uh
04:56 now I've just got the data for four
04:59 hostels right
05:02 I can also say that don't just show me
05:05 the slices also tell me how many
05:07 students are there okay
05:11 so I could label this data okay so these
05:15 are called data labels
05:17 now if I add data labels you can see
05:20 that godavari has eight students kaveri
05:24 has five
05:26 uh Sarah U has six
05:29 yamuna has three and ganga has eight
05:34 and I am able to see all of this just by
05:38 looking at this pie chart I do not have
05:40 to go and look at this table that I have
05:43 here right
05:45 so uh I could do other things I could as
05:49 an example
05:51 uh
05:54 change series chart type so let's say I
05:57 don't want to look at it
05:59 uh as a pie chart another interesting
06:03 thing is to look at it as a bar chart
06:06 right or what in uh here is called a
06:10 column
06:11 okay so let's
06:14 do this
06:16 and this is another very very common
06:18 chart okay
06:20 uh
06:21 this is typically used to show
06:25 performance so I would not perhaps use
06:28 this to show the breakup amongst hostels
06:31 but let's say I wanted to look at grades
06:34 ok now it's an excellent chart to show
06:39 grades
06:41 so let's look at
06:43 grid
06:44 so it shows you in some sense what not
06:47 in some sense it it actually does show
06:50 you how many students got an A how many
06:52 got a B how many got a C how many got a
06:55 D
06:55 and usually this
06:58 chart should actually be you know sort
07:01 of symmetric around you know number of
07:03 A's should be number equal to number of
07:05 D's number of B should be equal to
07:07 number of C's right so it should be a
07:09 nice
07:10 sort of
07:12 how do I you know it should be like this
07:16 our chart is a little bit
07:19 skewed right
07:21 uh but
07:23 the fact that I could draw this uh sort
07:27 of very easily uh using you know a bar
07:31 chart gives me a very good indication
07:34 already uh you know that perhaps the
07:37 grading has been somewhat liberal right
07:41 because you can see that the peak is
07:43 more to the left and not so much to the
07:46 center
07:47 okay
07:48 so this is a very useful chart normally
07:52 I would use this chart when I'm trying
07:55 to compare uh you know total number of
07:59 A's to total number of B's so I'm
08:00 comparing two uh two holes right so I'm
08:05 comparing uh the entire set of A's to
08:08 the entire set of B's to the entire set
08:10 of C's so the bar chart is most
08:12 intuitively uh obvious if you are
08:16 comparing a whole set of one kind let's
08:20 say I am comparing the total number of
08:22 cars uh you know with the total number
08:25 of Auto rickshaws or I am comparing the
08:27 total number of scooters to a total
08:30 number of motorcycles
08:31 a great way to represent would be bar
08:35 charts uh the next thing perhaps to look
08:40 at is uh
08:45 and unfortunately this data doesn't have
08:48 it but uh let us say and I'll create a
08:52 new set of data
08:54 so
08:55 let's
08:56 do that
08:58 uh the third key area where the third
09:02 key sort of data that we often need to
09:04 represent is Trends right uh what is the
09:09 example of a trend example of a trend is
09:11 how do a student's marks vary across
09:14 semesters okay and I have just taken a
09:18 simple data set here this is not a
09:19 complete data set this is just an
09:21 example so that you get an understanding
09:24 so what do I have here I have roll
09:27 number
09:28 uh for a semester and marks right so
09:34 in the first semester this student got
09:38 uh
09:41 34 marks the second semester also she
09:44 got 34 and the third semester she got 28
09:47 4th semester 34 and so on and so forth
09:49 right now this data is extremely boring
09:53 and it's very hard for me to figure out
09:56 what is really happening with the
09:58 students marks right now how do I uh
10:02 sort of get try and get a trend the
10:05 first thing is I want to see what
10:07 happens so
10:10 uh this data is currently uh in a sort
10:14 of uh it's a table but I want to view it
10:18 as a two dimensional table right roll
10:20 number versus semester so of course we
10:23 know our very powerful tool which is
10:26 Pivot so let's go and create a pivot
10:29 and we'll create and in this pivot what
10:32 we'll do is
10:33 for a given roll number
10:35 for a given semester
10:37 I want to see his or her marks okay
10:41 and
10:42 uh something we can see perhaps you can
10:46 see that student number one
10:49 has had consistently while of course
10:51 there have been some ups and downs
10:53 consistently good marks hmm
10:57 student number two
10:59 uh marks first went down then they went
11:03 up
11:05 then they again went down
11:07 in student three actually started off
11:09 very weak right I think he was perhaps
11:12 suggesting being in a hostel or whatever
11:14 but you can see that as time has gone by
11:17 this guy has figured out uh how to study
11:21 what he needs to do he's really caught
11:23 on he's worked hard I think and you can
11:26 see that his marks have been very good
11:27 perhaps after the third semester
11:30 but
11:31 very hard to sort of see this
11:34 intuitively right a lot of numbers I'd
11:38 really like to see this in some form of
11:40 a picture
11:41 a very common uh method that people use
11:46 for doing this is called
11:50 uh
11:51 line graphs sorry
11:54 and there I'm going to insert here so
11:57 you can see this line or area chart you
11:60 pick an line chart and pick a 2d line
12:03 right now what is this showing this is
12:06 showing you
12:08 uh
12:09 students and marks and each line is
12:14 showing how you know the students have
12:17 performed in first semester but this is
12:19 not what I want right I really want what
12:22 I want is
12:24 in the
12:26 x-axis I want semesters
12:29 and I want one line per student
12:33 okay so now you can see this is this
12:37 student you can see really really he
12:39 shot up right he's shot up
12:43 and then of course his sort of
12:46 performances
12:47 uh
12:49 quite quite good actually
12:51 this student is a good student you can
12:53 see that she is always got like really
12:56 high grades you know either age or B is
12:59 but this student sort of has been much
13:02 more fluctuating right
13:05 some semesters is
13:07 performance is not so good other
13:09 semesters it's very very good so you can
13:12 see that compared to this table
13:15 looking at this chart gives you a very
13:18 intuitive idea of
13:20 of what is the data what are the trends
13:24 in the data how does data change with
13:26 time line graphs are best to represent
13:30 data changes with time data changes with
13:34 times are also called Trends and you can
13:37 see Trends let us say in you know how
13:41 many people are purchasing from Flipkart
13:44 or Amazon uh or you know how many people
13:48 are getting employed in the IT industry
13:51 how many people are graduating with a
13:54 BSC in data science all of these Trends
13:57 all of these sets of data can be viewed
14:00 as a
14:02 you know time data sets that vary with
14:05 time and the best way perhaps to
14:08 represent some of this is to draw this
14:12 picture just as
14:14 uh
14:15 as a line chart if you if you think that
14:19 this chart is very complicated what you
14:21 can do is you know just
14:25 uh
14:26 let's just look at the trend for one
14:29 student right
14:31 if you just look at the trend for one
14:33 student
14:35 you will be able to see
14:37 ah
14:39 sorry this let me just move this here
14:42 you can see that this particular student
14:44 has done
14:45 consistently well
14:47 if I look at the next student
14:53 you can see that this student's
14:55 performance has been very volatile
14:59 and this student is really picked up you
15:01 know he began sort of weak but once he's
15:05 got the hang of the course he's done
15:07 very very well
15:09 so so this gives you a very good feel
15:11 for which students are doing well which
15:14 students perhaps need a little bit more
15:16 attention and then if I overlay all
15:19 these four three lines you can see how
15:22 all the students have done together so
15:24 you can draw a single line chart you can
15:26 draw a multi-line chart you know again
15:29 this is not uh
15:32 you know some you just have to practice
15:35 you have to play around you have to be
15:37 creative with how you represent your
15:39 data visually but broadly I would say
15:42 that the bulk of the data that we are
15:45 going to look at in this course can
15:48 either be represented as a bar chart
15:51 as a line chart or as a pie chart in
15:55 some cases we are going to look at a
15:56 scatter chart and you know scatter
15:59 charts are useful if you are looking at
16:02 three dimensional data but I'll let you
16:05 go ahead and explore that on your own at
16:09 some point when we come to uh you know I
16:13 think it's the case study on e-commerce
16:15 we will look at scatter charts in some
16:18 more detail
