00:00 foreign
00:04 [Music]
00:15 Market
00:20 and some idea of
00:22 I mean I don't think that correlation
00:24 between you tend to buy and finance
00:28 was so good but we got some idea that
00:31 people who borrow
00:33 borrowings
00:35 are likely to borrow more to buy it okay
00:38 that's fine
00:39 so
00:41 um somehow going down this path of
00:43 looking at consumer
00:45 information it's purchasing decisions
00:47 information and then trying to figure
00:49 out
00:50 patterns of lending and all
00:53 is a little far-fetched I think there
00:55 should be a direct way of doing it by
00:56 going directly to the other side
00:59 where are the loans coming from it's
01:00 coming from certain kinds of financial
01:02 institutions which land right so can't
01:04 we just take data that is originating
01:06 from financial institutions sure
01:08 production data producer data but so
01:11 wherever originations are there where
01:12 are Finance where are loans are
01:14 originated
01:15 and surely these things are getting
01:17 reported somewhere right civil score
01:18 there are these credit rating scores
01:19 there are various places where loan
01:21 information gets reported so if you can
01:23 collect data from that origination data
01:26 loan origination data it may have very
01:28 few Fields that's correct okay right
01:30 suppose we get hold of data like that
01:32 and stare at it for some time you're
01:34 getting a picture you got a this side
01:35 picture okay get a picture of that side
01:37 you're going to demand side picture
01:38 you've got a demand side picture now
01:40 you'll get a supply side picture and
01:42 that together they will you know give
01:45 you a much better view of what's going
01:48 on in this industry right so you want to
01:50 understand basically what kind of
01:51 lending is going on in the marketplace
01:53 so people will be willing to share this
01:55 data GB for study purposes samples you
01:58 can always get okay okay right you can
02:01 always get samples such sample data you
02:03 can get okay with Anonymous of course
02:05 people share
02:07 and they do share because they share
02:09 because they people credit scores and
02:11 all that have to be prepared so
02:11 everybody's lending has to be stated
02:13 right with the credit score credit
02:14 agency credit rating agency
02:17 so
02:18 um and I think even uh government RBI
02:21 also mandates I think some models
02:24 of loans right because they calculate
02:28 which loans are potentially going to
02:29 become non-professionals yeah yeah okay
02:33 makes sense so
02:35 um
02:36 so assume you have some origination data
02:39 sure
02:40 then we can hopefully study it and make
02:43 a better picture it that makes sense
02:44 right yeah
02:46 so I understand that we have such such a
02:48 data yes we've got one data set huh so
02:51 maybe we should look at that data set
02:52 okay it doesn't have you know compared
02:54 to the previous data sets it's a
02:56 somewhat it has lots of rows but fewer
03:00 columns okay okay so if you look at the
03:02 row is what one row is one is one loan
03:05 one single loan yeah I think we have
03:07 like almost eight thousand information
03:09 about eight thousand loans yeah it's a
03:11 lot that had a few number of rows more
03:12 colors
03:14 I see yeah
03:16 because that was this is also a sample
03:18 but it's a bigger sample
03:20 that was a smaller sample ah
03:23 but it has only some 11
03:26 columns okay okay
03:29 so the First Column is loan ID
03:32 which is like a unique ID of uh each
03:36 load each load right so that the lender
03:39 can keep track
03:40 of you know Melinda has borrowed 10 lakh
03:44 Rupees to buy a house kind of thing um
03:47 the second is the second and third
03:51 columns have to be read together right
03:53 so it tells us when the loan was given
03:56 was first given
03:59 so if it says Q 1 F by Twenty it means
04:01 given as April to June of yeah so so FY
04:04 here means Financial year
04:07 Financial year in India begins on April
04:10 1st
04:11 and ends uh March 31st so FY 20 would be
04:16 the year ending 31st March 2020 so it's
04:21 actually April 2019 to March 2020.
04:27 okay so q1 FY 20 and it Financial year
04:31 is divided into four quarters of three
04:33 months see three months each
04:35 so q1 FY 20 is actually 2019 is yes it
04:39 is April May June of 2019.
04:45 Q2 FY 20 is
04:48 July August September of 2019
04:51 Q3 FY 20 would be October November
04:56 December of if 2019 and Q4 FY 20 would
05:00 be January February March 2020. now we
05:04 have finally committed to indeed okay so
05:06 if I so when you say FY 20 it basically
05:09 means April 2019 to March 2020 correct
05:12 all right that's clear okay
05:14 [Music]
05:15 um
05:16 then there's a thing called segment
05:17 segment so let's look at what is segment
05:20 of loan right segment of loan seems to
05:22 be in three categories
05:25 there are commercial loans commercials
05:27 give it businesses given to businesses
05:28 yeah to run a business to run a business
05:31 it could be for trading it could be for
05:36 [Music]
05:42 like I might have done some Project work
05:45 for you yeah and you'll pay me later
05:47 correct meanwhile I have to working
05:48 capital I have to take care yes right
05:50 yes
05:50 so for that I might need a lot of direct
05:53 or I might just be exporting some thing
05:56 money will come after three months after
05:58 I ship it it'll reach there that guy
06:00 will accept the product then only I'll
06:02 get the money like that yes there will
06:04 be some time period yes so these are all
06:06 commercial loans or I might just buy
06:08 some take the loan to manufacture
06:10 something manufacturer
06:12 I mean actually I have to I may even
06:14 take a loan to set up a factory to set
06:15 up a factory which is a capital capital
06:18 purchase right so all of these are
06:20 commercial yes and second big category
06:24 is retail retail is a
06:27 what we saw already correct you know
06:29 buying a scooter so it could be buying a
06:31 house
06:32 buying a scooter
06:33 uh going getting a degree getting a
06:36 degree buying television or a
06:38 refrigerator yeah yeah it could be a
06:41 personal loan
06:43 you may just take a loan to do something
06:45 expense yeah right or uh for a wedding
06:49 or something yeah
06:52 you know it could be a loan because
06:54 somebody fell ill
06:56 no typically these kind of loans whether
06:57 you do commercial or retail or whatever
06:60 the lender will see different types of
07:02 lenders are there but lender will
07:04 be worried if he gives a larger ticket
07:06 loan
07:07 and he'll want to secure it securitize
07:09 it right he will so myself TV is that
07:12 commercial loans will typically be
07:15 bigger tickets because businesses will
07:19 borrow so if they are doing Capital
07:21 purchase that means they're buying
07:23 something and for which they need a loan
07:24 then it is then the bank can basically
07:27 just uh
07:32 you're buying a
07:35 uh machine which is worth three crores
07:39 yeah bank will not give three crores it
07:40 will say I'll give you two crores
07:42 you put one crore and you buy the
07:44 machine and uh if you don't don't pay
07:48 I'll take back that machine and then
07:49 I'll sell it in the market maybe I get
07:51 to and of course and I get my money back
07:52 correct right correct so that way the
07:55 bank is reasonably
07:56 insured that they can get their money
07:58 back but in the case of uh similarly for
08:01 land also House of the same place I can
08:03 always yes mortgage I can take the house
08:05 yes in case you don't pay the loan I
08:07 will take away the house yes
08:15 but in this case typically banks will
08:18 see the contract they'll see the
08:20 validity contract right so if you've
08:21 basically got an export order
08:23 and if it's from a well-known reputed
08:25 company or if you got an order from Tata
08:26 or something the repeated company okay
08:28 it's a purchase order you have in your
08:30 hand so against that the bank feels
08:31 confident
08:32 that if you can deliver it that the
08:34 company will pay
08:35 and against that they can get their
08:37 money back so that's how they feel
08:38 comfortable that something is there yes
08:40 a contract is there but my guess is that
08:42 alone like that probably has a slightly
08:44 higher interest rate whatever I are
08:46 interested they will look at your track
08:48 record of repeating such loans then only
08:49 they'll give you the loan level right
08:52 ah retail is not like that but no retail
08:55 of course if you're buying a scooter I
08:56 can I guess
08:57 you see I think if you're using it to
09:01 buy an asset like a house or scooter or
09:03 a car then there's no problem then there
09:05 is still something you know it is an
09:07 asset packing
09:09 uh education a television or a
09:12 refrigerator is a little bit you know
09:15 even if the bank takes the refrigerator
09:18 back who will they sell it they can't
09:19 sell it
09:25 take loans for weddings as an example
09:27 it's unclear what's a retail loan so in
09:30 this case you just have to go with the
09:31 guy the track record of that person and
09:33 whether he is employed he's getting a
09:36 salary I look at the salary slip
09:38 I get the confidence that this person
09:40 has got an income
09:41 but I think the other thing Banks also
09:44 do gve is that as the loan becomes
09:46 riskier
09:48 they charge a higher interest rate
09:51 so a mortgage is probably the cheapest
09:53 retail loan that you can get a personal
09:56 loan especially house yeah because they
09:59 know what they can you know they know
10:00 how they can recover the money they can
10:02 just go take over the house the more
10:03 there is interested
10:07 okay it's interesting now unfortunately
10:09 we don't have the interest rate data
10:11 here but uh microfinance is the third
10:13 category which basically is for small
10:15 loans yes small shopkeepers small trade
10:18 loans trade loans
10:20 you know there's a vegetable guy who
10:22 needs a thousand rupees
10:26 or something okay take a microphone
10:29 something like that classic actually is
10:31 a shopkeeper who buys vegetables in the
10:34 morning
10:35 has to sell all of those vegetables by
10:37 end of day and then he returns alone yes
10:39 one day so essentially you've got a
10:41 single dealer and it's small it's like
10:43 probably 10 000 rupees not more than ten
10:46 thousand very small ticket sizes all
10:47 right okay so I think the category of
10:49 loan is clear then there is some lender
10:51 names
10:53 so there are three lenders that we've
10:55 got data for uh there's a company called
10:57 Bajaj finserv there's a company called
10:60 ICICI
11:01 and there's a company called SBI State
11:04 Bank State Bank so these are three
11:05 categories the different types of
11:06 lenders I think the State Bank basically
11:08 is a public sector government Bank yes
11:09 of course it's some shares are owned by
11:12 the public but yeah it's majority owned
11:14 by the government of India so it's a
11:15 government bank and ICICI is a private
11:17 bank
11:18 but both are banks yes and then Bajaj
11:21 finser is a company that belongs to a
11:25 category called non-banking Finance
11:27 Company it's not a bank non-banking not
11:30 a bank they don't have banking license
11:31 so strictly speaking non-banking finance
11:34 companies can't take deposits okay Banks
11:36 can take deposits so since Banks take
11:38 deposits from you and me we put our
11:41 savings in the bank deposits in the bank
11:43 they take deposits and then these
11:45 deposits they can create a pool of money
11:48 then they can lend but non-banking
11:50 finance company does not have deposits
11:52 so they don't have a source of income a
11:54 lot of money they don't have inflow
11:56 you can lend money so they have to get
11:58 the money from somewhere so nbfc might
11:60 take the money from a bank and land it
12:01 that's one possibility and BFC can take
12:04 can raise money by corporate deposits or
12:07 some other thing they have to do their
12:09 own Innovative way of raising money or
12:10 they have to borrow the money from a
12:12 bank so they may borrow money from the
12:13 bank at eight percent and lend it out
12:16 and get this what is called net interest
12:18 margin name of three percent are there
12:21 and then try to survive on that so
12:23 that's how the mbfcs operate sure so
12:25 Bajaj Finster so I guess there are three
12:26 examples
12:28 some companies which represent three
12:30 different categories correct they're not
12:31 banking finance companies yes
12:38 a type of loan
12:40 type of loan can be agricultural loans
12:43 loan for agriculture yes so as an
12:45 example I would need to buy fertilizer
12:46 fertilizers I need to buy seeds I need
12:49 to buy insecticides yeah I need to I
12:52 need to rent a tractor tractor tractor
12:54 yes yes things like that things like
12:56 that
12:57 auto loans auto loans auto loans is what
13:01 we have been discussing for a while so
13:03 we understand business loans also we
13:05 discussed right yeah
13:08 commercial vehicle loan is an
13:10 interesting it's an intersection of
13:12 commercial loans and vehicle vehicle
13:13 loans right yeah
13:16 as an example or a water tanker or a oil
13:19 tanker you know things like that correct
13:21 bustles bus bus bus right school bus
13:24 school bus and Runners yes yeah
13:28 consumer durable loans we discussed you
13:31 know television refrigerator air
13:33 conditioners yes many of these people
13:36 take on
13:37 loan credit card now what is a credit
13:41 card this is not actually a loan it's
13:43 not a I mean it's a difference is it
13:45 loan it's a it's a different it's a
13:47 coming from the other side
13:49 what do you mean in the sense that the
13:51 others are
13:52 objects for which loan is given
13:54 commercial legumes for the vehicle
13:55 you're giving a loan correct you're not
13:56 giving a loan for credit no no no no no
13:58 no no it's a mechanism of giving I don't
14:01 know it is a mechanism of giving loans
14:03 that are given via credit card correct
14:06 small ticket or it could be travel for
14:08 example mostly quite a few people to
14:10 travel you know you'll buy Hotel uh
14:13 vacation vacations
14:18 you might do that
14:20 with credit card
14:22 education loan big one big one yeah very
14:25 long gestation period right yes like
14:27 home loan yes gold loan gold loan gold
14:30 loan I think is when there is you place
14:33 gold as a security and take it alone
14:35 selected purpose of the loan is not
14:38 relevant not to buy gold it's not to buy
14:40 gold
14:41 today
14:44 against gold so it's like credit card in
14:47 that sense right gold is being used to
14:48 make a loan right
14:50 Home Loans home loans personal loans are
14:53 loans for which the objective is not
14:56 clear I mean you are doesn't have to be
14:58 declared yeah
15:00 property loan property loan again is I
15:03 think in the gold loan category it is a
15:05 loan against property yeah
15:08 object is you know why you want the loan
15:10 is not relevant it is a loan against
15:12 property yeah and two wheeler loans
15:15 actually I think vehicle loans which
15:18 probably means four-wheeler loads auto
15:20 loans probably means four wheeler loans
15:22 four wheeler and two wheeler loans is
15:24 two wheeler Villas okay
15:27 and some of these things don't fit into
15:29 this category like microfinance I think
15:31 there's none of this right so it's just
15:33 black yeah the cattle and all that codes
15:36 correct correct yeah that is we don't
15:39 know okay
15:41 the next thing is what was the value of
15:45 the loan originally sanctioned oh
15:48 originalization
15:49 now why is this important so let us say
15:53 I took a loan for one lakh
15:56 um
15:57 and I was supposed to repay that over
15:59 five years
16:01 at the end of the second year
16:04 I have repaid three lakhs hmm
16:07 this is some left there is seven lakhs
16:09 left
16:10 so the original value of the loan is
16:14 10 lakhs outstanding value is relaxed
16:18 yes 700 lakhs
16:21 so both are important both are important
16:23 both are important both are important so
16:25 you can see that some loans are really
16:26 big 36 crores 90 lakhs 96 000.
16:30 this is actually even bigger right this
16:32 is all commercial loan that's right yeah
16:35 let's see this is this is one and a half
16:38 crores
16:39 this is one and a half crores this is no
16:42 but this is some 36 crores also is there
16:44 oh yeah this is 36 crores 90 lakhs 96
16:47 correct correct okay actually we'll do
16:50 one thing if you put commas now then
16:52 Things become easier to read them
16:56 so this is
16:58 15 million rupees which is one and a
17:01 half crores
17:02 this is 20 261 million there's 369
17:06 million that's 36.9 37 crores
17:11 actually it'd be interesting to maybe we
17:13 should just sort this
17:16 curiosity okay sorry yeah sorted by G
17:20 declining oh sorry sorry I should have
17:23 done custom sort no
17:26 custom by G
17:29 by column
17:30 G
17:32 largest to smallest zero
17:35 yeah
17:38 yeah so there is something that is 41
17:41 crores
17:44 41 crores and it's clear all the big
17:46 loans are commercial and then it starts
17:48 falling off can you see 20 became two
17:51 crores just go down
17:52 by the time your eight or eight thousand
17:54 entries correct so we are still in 50
17:57 yeah good let's go yeah
18:11 yeah even in commercial loans it started
18:13 falling so this is if it's more you see
18:17 the tail will be very long it's called
18:18 long tail right yeah long tail means
18:21 that you
18:22 the distribution is correct like that
18:24 okay like that is going on
18:27 yeah these are like all One lakh loans
18:28 there are many unlike loans they are
18:31 still in 400 remember 800 yeah huh yeah
18:33 we're going to fall below one lakh
18:35 before we go to 800. which is 10 percent
18:38 see we have gone below one leg ah in 500
18:41 itself
18:43 one only one percent of the loans are
18:45 above one lakh
18:47 good card
18:50 and now you see what are the kind of
18:52 loans right now they're no longer
18:54 commercial it's all retail and
18:56 microfinance
18:58 I want to see how small the loan gets
19:01 you have 500 rupees
19:05 well it could be actually
19:09 some data itself is not there okay okay
19:13 yeah but it goes down to
19:19 goes down to about a thousand five
19:21 hundred four hundred and sixty five
19:23 smallest turkey anyway
19:25 so two thousand three thousand like that
19:27 300 okay okay
19:29 tells you something we have only data
19:32 this actually gvn will probably see this
19:35 in a later case study this is fairly
19:38 typical of data sets that if you have a
19:41 large data set a very small number of
19:44 items will represent will represent a
19:47 very large percentage of the ah
19:50 yeah you know yeah that's 80 20 hours
19:54 yeah yeah okay okay so let us
19:59 once again
20:00 remove the sort so custom sort now I
20:05 will sort and column A which is how it
20:08 was
20:11 um it was inserted on me here it was
20:13 inserted on me
20:15 undo sir Ctrl Z
20:25 yeah yeah okay okay
20:30 now so we have original loan size and we
20:33 have outstanding launches what is the
20:36 next one age age
20:38 and why is the age of the borrower
20:39 important especially in retail loans it
20:43 impacts the ability to repay so as an
20:45 example if I am a 50 year old man and I
20:49 want to take a mortgage for 20 years
20:51 and I'm gonna retire at 60. then it is
20:54 unclear to the bank how I'm going to
20:56 repay after
20:57 correct for 20 years correct maybe 15
20:60 years correct yeah
21:02 so therefore the age of the borrower is
21:04 relevant
21:05 what is the other thing that is relevant
21:08 is what is my income
21:10 because the bank wants to know
21:12 if based on my income I have the
21:15 capability of paying my Emi commercial
21:18 means income must be the company
21:19 companies income
21:22 individuals
21:27 the next
21:29 is
21:31 a column called new to Credit
21:35 First Time borrower okay
21:39 this goes back GB to your point of
21:41 financial savvy
21:44 anybody who is a first emperor probably
21:46 doesn't have Financial Services
21:49 yes it is borrowed many times and
21:51 returned many times he is likely to be
21:53 to borrow once again in return once
21:56 again
21:60 okay yeah and then the last column is
22:03 some demographic data which is gender
22:05 you know
22:06 male and female they could be others
22:08 there could be others yeah geography of
