# Understanding Market Share - Part 2

## Visualizing Loan Distributions

- Loan size distribution often follows a long tail: a few large loans, many small loans.
- Visualizing this with sorted line charts helps identify the long tail pattern.
- E-commerce and retail often show similar patterns: a few high-value items, many low-value items.

## Analyzing Lender Market Share

- Use pivot tables to analyze the number and value of loans by lender (e.g., Bajaj Finserv, SBI, ICICI).
- Pie charts can show the proportion of loans originated by each lender.
- Market share by number of loans may differ from market share by value of loans.
- NBFCs, public sector banks, and private banks may have different strategies and focus areas.

## Segment and Strategy Analysis

- Lenders may focus on different segments: commercial, retail, or microfinance.
- Pivot tables and filters help reveal these strategies (e.g., ICICI focuses on retail, Bajaj Finserv on commercial).
- Analyzing by loan type (e.g., two-wheeler loans) shows which lenders dominate specific markets.
- Company websites may promote loans for specific products, acting as both sales and loan platforms.

## Ticket Size and Loan Types

- Average ticket size varies by lender and loan type.
- Two-wheeler loans have similar average ticket sizes across lenders.
- Car loans and other products may show different patterns.

## Trend and Market Share Over Time

- Trends in loan originations can be visualized using line or stacked bar charts.
- Market share can shift over time as lenders change strategies or focus on new segments.
- Example: Bajaj Finserv's share in two-wheeler loans fluctuates over the years.
- Stacked graphs are useful for visualizing year-wise market share.

## Practical Insights

- Pivot tables allow for rapid, multi-dimensional analysis of large datasets.
- Filtering and slicing data by year, segment, or loan type reveals deeper insights.
- Outliers and large loans can skew value-based analysis; count-based analysis may be more stable.
- Demographic and income analysis can further refine understanding of lending patterns (to be covered next).

## Key Points

- Visual tools like pivot tables, pie charts, and stacked graphs are essential for market share analysis.
- Lenders have distinct strategies, visible in the data.
- Market share and trends can be analyzed by number, value, segment, and over time.
- Further analysis can include demographic and income-based cuts for deeper insights.
