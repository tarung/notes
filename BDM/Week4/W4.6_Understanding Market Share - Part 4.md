# Understanding Market Share - Part 4

## Gender and Demographic Analysis

- Men are more likely to use credit cards than women; seniors are more conservative in credit card usage.
- Average credit card spending is similar across gender and age groups.
- Market share trends can be analyzed by gender, age group, and lender type.

## Market Share Trends Over Time

- NBFCs are gradually gaining market share in credit cards, while PSU and private banks are losing share.
- Market share trends can be visualized using line and stacked bar charts.
- Age group trends show that seniors are less active in borrowing, while middle-aged and youth are more active.

- The proportion of new to credit borrowers fluctuates over time, influenced by external events (e.g., COVID-19).

## Microfinance and Auto/Two-Wheeler Loans

- Microfinance loans are small, with average ticket sizes similar to or slightly higher than credit card loans.
- Most microfinance loans go to middle-aged borrowers; trends show a decline in borrowing across all age groups during COVID-19.
- Auto and two-wheeler loans show different patterns: NBFCs dominate two-wheeler loans, while PSU banks are more active in auto loans.
- Ticket sizes for auto and two-wheeler loans have increased over time, likely due to inflation.
- After COVID-19, middle-aged borrowers quickly recovered in two-wheeler loans, possibly due to safety concerns with public transport.

## Practical Insights

The discussion revolves around analyzing credit card usage and market share trends across different demographics, including gender and age groups. The participants explore data on credit card transactions, noting that men are more likely to use credit cards than women. They also examine market share shifts among lenders, finding that non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) are gaining ground, while public sector (PSU) banks are losing share. The conversation also touches on the trends of new credit borrowers and the implications for future lending strategies, particularly in relation to two-wheeler loans. The participants emphasize the importance of data visualization in understanding trends and making informed decisions in the lending market.

### Highlights

- Men use credit cards significantly more than women, with men being twice as likely to use them.
- NBFCs are gradually increasing their market share at the expense of PSU banks and private banks.
- There is a decline in credit card usage among new borrowers during fiscal year 2021.
- The average ticket size for loans and the demographic breakdown by age groups were analyzed.
