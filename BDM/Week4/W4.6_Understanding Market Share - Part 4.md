# Understanding Market Share - Part 4

## Gender and Demographic Analysis

- Men are more likely to use credit cards than women; seniors are more conservative in credit card usage.
- Average credit card spending is similar across gender and age groups.
- Market share trends can be analyzed by gender, age group, and lender type.

## Market Share Trends Over Time

- NBFCs are gradually gaining market share in credit cards, while PSU and private banks are losing share.
- Market share trends can be visualized using line and stacked bar charts.
- Age group trends show that seniors are less active in borrowing, while middle-aged and youth are more active.
- "New to Credit" borrowers (first-time loan takers) are a significant segment, especially for credit cards.
- The proportion of new to credit borrowers fluctuates over time, influenced by external events (e.g., COVID-19).

## Microfinance and Auto/Two-Wheeler Loans

- Microfinance loans are small, with average ticket sizes similar to or slightly higher than credit card loans.
- Most microfinance loans go to middle-aged borrowers; trends show a decline in borrowing across all age groups during COVID-19.
- Auto and two-wheeler loans show different patterns: NBFCs dominate two-wheeler loans, while PSU banks are more active in auto loans.
- Ticket sizes for auto and two-wheeler loans have increased over time, likely due to inflation.
- After COVID-19, middle-aged borrowers quickly recovered in two-wheeler loans, possibly due to safety concerns with public transport.

## Practical Insights

- Pivot tables and visualizations enable rapid, multi-dimensional analysis of large datasets.
- Slicing and dicing data by year, segment, loan type, and demographics reveals deeper insights.
- The spreadsheet model (Excel, Google Sheets) is powerful for business data management and analysis.

## Key Points

- Market share and borrowing patterns can be analyzed by gender, age, lender type, and loan type.
- Trends over time reveal the impact of external events and changing borrower behavior.
- Data visualization and spreadsheet tools are essential for effective business data analysis.
