# Understanding Market Share - Part 3

## Credit Card Lending and Analysis

- Credit card transactions are short-term loans, often interest-free if repaid on time.
- Credit card companies earn from merchant fees (MDR) and interest on unpaid balances.
- Data analysis may use synthetic data and anonymized lender names for privacy.

## Analyzing Credit Card Data

- Credit card transaction sizes range from a few hundred to nearly a lakh rupees.
- Average ticket size is around ₹30,000, with most transactions in the ₹25,000–₹35,000 range.
- Pivot tables help analyze market share by lender type (private, public, NBFC) and by transaction value or count.
- Private banks dominate credit card lending by number of transactions, followed by NBFCs and public sector banks.
- Average transaction size is similar across lender types.

## Demographic and Age Group Analysis

- Borrowers can be grouped by age: youth (≤30), middle-aged (31–50), and seniors (>50).
- Most credit card transactions are by middle-aged borrowers; seniors are a small segment.
- Lender strategies may target different age groups (e.g., private banks focus on middle-aged, NBFCs on youth).
- Gender and other demographic fields can provide further insights.

## Trend Analysis

- Trends in credit card usage and average ticket size can be visualized over time.
- Average ticket size has increased slightly over the years, tracking inflation.
- Number of transactions by age group shows that seniors are less active, while middle-aged and youth are more active.
- External events (e.g., COVID-19) may impact transaction trends.

## Practical Insights

- Even with limited data fields, pivot tables and filters enable rich analysis.
- Visualizations (pie, bar, line charts) clarify patterns in market share and demographics.
- Data limitations (e.g., lack of borrower ID) may restrict some analyses, but proxies can be used.

## Key Points

- Credit card lending is a major segment, with distinct lender strategies and demographic patterns.
- Market share, average ticket size, and trends can be analyzed by lender and borrower characteristics.
- Data privacy and synthetic data are important considerations in financial analysis.
