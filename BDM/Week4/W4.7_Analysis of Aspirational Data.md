# Analysis of Aspirational Data

## Introduction

- This module analyzes aspirational data, focusing on air conditioner (AC) and cooler ownership and purchase intentions.
- The data includes state, region (urban/rural), income group, and responses about ACs and coolers.

## Data Preparation and Cleaning

- Identify relevant columns: state, region, income group, AC/cooler ownership, purchase intention.
- Clean the data by hiding or removing irrelevant columns.
- Use filters to focus on respondents with complete data.

## Using Pivot Tables and Filters

- Pivot tables help summarize data by state, region, and product ownership.
- Filters allow analysis of specific groups (e.g., only those who own ACs, or only urban respondents).
- Example: Out of 62 respondents, 42 own ACs, 20 do not.

## Statewise and Regionwise Analysis

- Statewise analysis shows the distribution of AC ownership across India.
- Urban respondents are more likely to own ACs than rural respondents.
- Data visualization (e.g., filled maps, bar charts) helps identify patterns.

## Income Group Classification

- Income groups are classified as low, medium, or high based on reported annual income.
- VLOOKUP and UNIQUE functions help automate classification and extract unique income groups.
- Example: 31 respondents are low income, 24 medium, 7 high income.

## Purchase Intention and Behavior

- High-income respondents are most likely to already own ACs; all 7 high-income respondents in the sample own ACs.
- Medium-income: 20/24 own ACs; 17 intend to buy.
- Low-income: 15/31 own ACs; 16 intend to buy now, often due to climate (e.g., humid states).
- Purchase intention can be further analyzed by state, region, and income group.

## Comparative Analysis: Coolers vs. ACs

- Similar analysis can be done for coolers: ownership, purchase intention, and transition from coolers to ACs.
- Comparative analysis reveals patterns in product adoption across income and region.

## Practical Insights

- Pivot tables and filters enable rapid, multi-dimensional analysis of survey data.
- Data visualization helps communicate findings effectively.
- Understanding aspirational data supports better marketing and product planning.

## Key Points

- Aspirational data reveals what people want to buy and why.
- Income, region, and climate influence ownership and purchase intention for ACs and coolers.
- Spreadsheet tools (Excel, Google Sheets) are powerful for survey data analysis.
