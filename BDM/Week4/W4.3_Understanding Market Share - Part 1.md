# Understanding Market Share - Part 1

## Introduction

- Market share analysis helps understand the distribution and control of lending in the financial sector.
- Data can be collected from both the demand side (borrowers) and the supply side (lenders/financial institutions).

## Loan Origination Data

- Loan origination data provides insight into the types and distribution of loans in the market.
- Such data typically includes thousands of rows (loans) and a limited number of columns (fields).
- Key fields: Loan ID, origination date (quarter and financial year), segment, lender, type of loan, original and outstanding value, borrower demographics.

## Understanding Loan Segments

- **Commercial Loans**: For businesses (working capital, capital purchases, project financing).
- **Retail Loans**: For individuals (housing, vehicles, education, personal expenses).
- **Microfinance**: Small, short-term loans for small businesses or individuals (e.g., shopkeepers, vendors).

## Types of Lenders

- **Public Sector Banks**: Government-owned (e.g., SBI).
- **Private Banks**: Privately owned (e.g., ICICI).
- **NBFCs**: Non-banking finance companies (e.g., Bajaj Finserv) that cannot take deposits but can lend money.

## Types of Loans

- Agricultural, auto, business, commercial vehicle, consumer durable, credit card, education, gold, home, personal, property, two-wheeler, and microfinance loans.
- Some loans are secured (backed by collateral), others are unsecured.

## Loan Values and Distribution

- Original loan value: Amount initially borrowed.
- Outstanding loan value: Amount yet to be repaid.
- Loan sizes vary widely, from a few hundred rupees to several crores.
- Distribution often follows a long tail: a few large loans, many small loans.

## Borrower Demographics

- Age and income of the borrower are important for assessing repayment ability.
- "New to Credit" indicates first-time borrowers, often with less financial history.
- Demographic data includes gender and geography.

## Key Points

- Market share analysis requires both demand and supply side data.
- Loan origination data is rich and allows for detailed analysis of lending patterns.
- Understanding segments, lenders, and loan types is crucial for interpreting the data.
- The distribution of loan sizes and borrower demographics provides insight into market structure and risk.
