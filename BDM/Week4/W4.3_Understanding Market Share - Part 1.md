# Understanding Market Share - Part 1

## Introduction

- Market share analysis helps understand the distribution and control of lending in the financial sector.
- Data can be collected from both the demand side (borrowers) and the supply side (lenders/financial institutions).

## Loan Origination Data

- Loan origination data provides insight into the types and distribution of loans in the market.
- Such data typically includes thousands of rows (loans) and a limited number of columns (fields).
- Key fields: Loan ID, origination date (quarter and financial year), segment, lender, type of loan, original and outstanding value, borrower demographics.

## Understanding Loan Segments

- **Commercial Loans**: For businesses (working capital, capital purchases, project financing).
- **Retail Loans**: For individuals (housing, vehicles, education, personal expenses).
- **Microfinance**: Small, short-term loans for small businesses or individuals (e.g., shopkeepers, vendors).

## Types of Lenders

- **Public Sector Banks**: Government-owned (e.g., SBI).
- **Private Banks**: Privately owned (e.g., ICICI).

- Outstanding loan value: Amount yet to be repaid.
- Loan sizes vary widely, from a few hundred rupees to several crores.
- Distribution often follows a long tail: a few large loans, many small loans.

## Borrower Demographics

- Age and income of the borrower are important for assessing repayment ability.
- "New to Credit" indicates first-time borrowers, often with less financial history.
- Demographic data includes gender and geography.

## Key Points

- Market share analysis requires both demand and supply side data.

The discussion revolves around understanding loan origination data and its implications for lending practices in various sectors, such as commercial, retail, and microfinance. The dialogue emphasizes the importance of leveraging data from financial institutions to analyze lending patterns and consumer behavior. Key elements of the loan data include loan types, origination dates, lender categories, loan values, and borrower demographics. The conversation also addresses how different types of loans, such as commercial loans, personal loans, and microfinance, are structured and assessed by lenders, with a focus on securing loans and evaluating borrower risk.

### Highlights

- The importance of loan origination data for understanding lending practices.
- Distinction between various loan segments: commercial, retail, and microfinance.
- The role of lenders, including traditional banks and non-banking finance companies (NBFCs).
- Key factors influencing loan approval: loan size, borrower's age, and income.
- The significance of credit scoring and borrower history in lending decisions.

### Key Insights

- **Loan Origination Data:** Collecting and analyzing loan origination data is essential for understanding the lending landscape. This data reveals trends in borrower behavior and lender practices, allowing for a comprehensive view of the financial ecosystem.
  
- **Loan Segmentation:** Different types of loans serve various purposes and have different risk profiles. For instance, commercial loans are generally larger and backed by collateral, while retail and microfinance loans are smaller and often unsecured, necessitating different evaluation criteria by lenders.
  
- **Lender Categories:** Understanding the distinctions between banks and non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) is crucial. While banks can accept deposits and have a broader source of funds, NBFCs often rely on borrowing from banks or raising capital through other means, affecting their lending strategies and interest rates.
  
- **Risk Assessment Factors:** The age of the borrower and their income are critical factors for lenders. A younger borrower may have a longer repayment period, while older borrowers must demonstrate the ability to repay loans before retirement, influencing the lender's decision-making process.
  
- **Credit Scoring Impact:** Credit scores play a significant role in determining loan eligibility. A first-time borrower may face higher scrutiny and potentially higher interest rates due to lack of credit history, highlighting the importance of financial literacy.
  
- **Size Distribution of Loans:** The dataset analyzed reveals that a small number of large loans can represent a significant portion of the total loan volume, illustrating the '80/20 rule' in lending where a few clients may account for the majority of loan values.
  
- **Demographic Influences:** Borrower demographics, such as gender and geographic location, can influence lending decisions. Understanding these factors helps lenders assess risk and tailor their products to meet diverse customer needs.
