## Structured Notes

### Introduction

- This session focuses on analyzing sales and revenue trends using Excel pivot tables and charts.
- The goal is to identify patterns in sales volume and revenue over time and by day of the week.

### Analyzing Volume Trends by Date

- Use a pivot table with dates as rows and sum of sales as values.
- Remove blank values for clarity.
- Insert a line chart to visualize sales volume over time.
- Observation: No clear trend in sales volume over the 15-day period; values fluctuate up and down.

### Analyzing Revenue Trends by Date

- Repeat the process with revenue as the value in the pivot table.
- Format revenue as currency for readability.
- Insert a line chart for revenue trend.
- Observation: Revenue also shows no significant trend over the 15 days; daily revenue is roughly 25â€“30 lakhs.

### Monthly and SKU Context

- The data covers only 30 SKUs, but companies may have thousands.
- Monthly revenue can be estimated by multiplying daily averages.

### Analyzing Trends by Day of the Week

- Add a new column to the sales data to extract the day of the week from the date (using the TEXT function in Excel).
- Create a pivot table with day of the week as rows and sum of sales as values.
- Observation: Sales volume is higher on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday; lower on weekends.
- Possible explanation: People may shop online during weekdays and visit malls on weekends.
- Note: The number of each weekday in the data may affect results (e.g., three Thursdays in the sample).

### Revenue Trends by Day of the Week

- Repeat the analysis with revenue as the value.
- Format as currency.
- Observation: No significant trend in revenue by day of the week.

### Key Insights

- No strong trends in sales volume or revenue over the 15-day period.
- Slight increase in sales volume midweek; weekends are lower.
- Data artifacts (like uneven weekday counts) can affect analysis.
- More data would be needed for deeper insights.

## Examples

- **Pivot Table Setup:**
  - Rows: Date or Day of the Week
  - Values: Sum of Sales or Sum of Revenue
- **Excel Formula for Day of Week:**
  - `=TEXT(A2, "ddd")` (returns day abbreviation from date)
- **Line Chart:**
  - Used to visualize trends over time or by category.

## Key Points

- Use pivot tables and charts to analyze trends in sales and revenue.
- Extract day of the week from dates for weekday analysis.
- Watch for data artifacts that may skew results.
- More data provides more reliable trend analysis.
