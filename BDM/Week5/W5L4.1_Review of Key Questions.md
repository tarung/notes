# Review of Key Questions in E-commerce Data Analysis

## Introduction

- E-commerce operations involve multiple stakeholders, each with different priorities: Planning Head, CFO, and CEO.
- Key questions are driven by logistics, inventory, revenue, and growth objectives.

## Planning Head’s Questions

- Which SKUs are high volume (sell the most units)?
- Which SKUs generate the most revenue?
- Are high volume and high revenue SKUs the same or different?
- Where should high volume and high revenue SKUs be placed in the warehouse for efficient and secure order assembly?
- Which SKUs are nearing stock depletion and need to be reordered?
- How many days of sales are left for each SKU (inventory coverage)?
- Are there trends or patterns in sales (e.g., by day, week, or month)?
- Which days have the highest sales?
- Which items should be stocked more or less, and where should they be stocked (which warehouse/region)?

## CFO’s Questions

- How much capital is tied up in inventory?
- Are there stock outs (customer orders not fulfilled due to lack of inventory)?
- Why are certain SKUs (e.g., m01) not being restocked despite demand?

## CEO’s Questions

- What percentage of local customer orders are fulfilled from the local (forward) distribution center?
- Which business unit (BU) is growing the fastest (e.g., lifestyle, consumables, mobiles)?
- How to plan and maintain high service levels for important SKUs (e.g., one-day delivery for mobiles)?

## Key Points

- E-commerce data analysis supports decision-making for logistics, inventory, and business growth.
