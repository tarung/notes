# Volume Pareto Analysis in E-commerce

## Introduction

- Volume Pareto analysis helps identify which SKUs contribute most to total sales volume.
- The process uses pivot tables to sum sales for each SKU across all dates and locations.

## Steps in Volume Pareto Analysis

- Use a pivot table to aggregate sales data by SKU.
- Sort SKUs by total sales volume (sum of sales) in descending order.
- Calculate the cumulative percentage of total sales for each SKU.
- Identify the top SKUs that contribute the most to overall sales volume.
- Compare the results to the Pareto Principle (e.g., does 20% of SKUs account for 80% of sales?).

## Key Insights

- In the sample data, the top SKUs (e.g., F01, M01, L01) contribute a significant share of total sales.
- The Pareto Principle may not always hold exactly, but a small number of SKUs often account for a large portion of sales.
- Volume analysis can be repeated for revenue to identify high-revenue SKUs.

## Practical Use

- Focus inventory, marketing, and logistics efforts on high-volume/high-revenue SKUs.
- Use cumulative percentage and sorting to prioritize business decisions.

## Key Points

- Volume Pareto analysis reveals which products drive most of the business.
- Pivot tables and cumulative calculations are essential tools for this analysis.
- The 80/20 rule is a useful guideline, but actual data may vary.
