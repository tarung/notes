# Volume Pareto Analysis in E-commerce

## Introduction

- Volume Pareto analysis helps identify which SKUs contribute most to total sales volume.
- The process uses pivot tables to sum sales for each SKU across all dates and locations.

## Steps in Volume Pareto Analysis

- Use a pivot table to aggregate sales data by SKU.
- Sort SKUs by total sales volume (sum of sales) in descending order.
- Calculate the cumulative percentage of total sales for each SKU.
- Identify the top SKUs that contribute the most to overall sales volume.
- Compare the results to the Pareto Principle (e.g., does 20% of SKUs account for 80% of sales?).

## Key Insights

- In the sample data, the top SKUs (e.g., F01, M01, L01) contribute a significant share of total sales.
- The Pareto Principle may not always hold exactly, but a small number of SKUs often account for a large portion of sales.
- Volume analysis can be repeated for revenue to identify high-revenue SKUs.

## Practical Use

- Focus inventory, marketing, and logistics efforts on high-volume/high-revenue SKUs.
- Use cumulative percentage and sorting to prioritize business decisions.

## Key Points

- Volume Pareto analysis reveals which products drive most of the business.
- Pivot tables and cumulative calculations are essential tools for this analysis.
- The 80/20 rule is a useful guideline, but actual data may vary.

### Notes

- ([00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOfl_ESI78U&t=0s)) ### Summary
The text discusses a detailed analysis involving sales and revenue data using Excel. It highlights the process of importing price data, calculating revenue, and creating pivot tables and charts to visualize sales performance. The use of functions like VLOOKUP is emphasized for automating data retrieval, while the importance of identifying revenue-generating SKUs (Stock Keeping Units) is stressed. The analysis reveals that a small percentage of SKUs contributes to a significant portion of total revenue, demonstrating a Pareto-like distribution. The text concludes with suggestions for further analysis and visualization to aid decision-making.

### Highlights

- **Automating Data Retrieval**: The text emphasizes the use of VLOOKUP in Excel to automate the extraction of price data from SKU Master to Sales Master.
- **Revenue Calculation**: It explains how revenue is calculated by multiplying units sold by price per unit.
- **Pivot Tables for Analysis**: The creation of pivot tables is discussed as a method to summarize revenue data across various dimensions such as SKU, city, and date.
- **Identifying Key Revenue Contributors**: The analysis identifies that a small number of SKUs contribute disproportionately to revenue, aligning with the 80/20 rule.
- **Visualization Techniques**: The text discusses creating scatter plots to visualize the relationship between sales volume and revenue, highlighting differences across categories.
- **Outlier Management**: It addresses the importance of removing outliers in charts to enhance clarity and presentation.
- **Recommendations for Action**: The narrative suggests that low-revenue, high-volume items should be reconsidered in inventory management.

### Key Insights

- **VLOOKUP Efficiency**: The use of the VLOOKUP function is crucial for efficiently merging price data with sales data, allowing for accurate revenue calculation without manual effort.
- **Revenue vs. Volume Dynamics**: The analysis shows that while some SKUs generate high revenue, others may sell in large volumes without contributing significantly to overall revenue, indicating a need for differentiated inventory strategies.
- **Pareto Principle Application**: The findings reflect the Pareto principle, where a small fraction of SKUs (20%) contributes to a large portion of revenue (80%), suggesting a focused approach on high-performing items.
- **Pivot Table Utility**: Pivot tables serve as a powerful tool for aggregating and visualizing data, enabling quick insights into revenue trends by SKU and other dimensions.
- **Importance of Data Visualization**: The text highlights the role of charts in presenting complex data simply and effectively, aiding stakeholders in understanding performance metrics.
- **Outlier Impact on Analysis**: The presence of outliers can skew visualizations, emphasizing the need for careful data cleaning before analysis.
- **Inventory Optimization**: Decisions about inventory should be guided by revenue contribution analysis, potentially leading to the discontinuation of low-performing SKUs.

### FAQs

- **Q1: What is VLOOKUP and how is it used?**
  - A1: VLOOKUP is an Excel function used to look up and retrieve data from a specific column in a table. It helps automate the process of merging data sets, such as prices from SKU Master to sales data.

- **Q2: How is revenue calculated in the analysis?**
  - A2: Revenue is calculated by multiplying the number of units sold by the average price per unit for each SKU.

- **Q3: What is the significance of pivot tables in sales analysis?**
  - A3: Pivot tables allow for the aggregation and summarization of large data sets, making it easier to analyze revenue trends across different dimensions like SKU and location.

- **Q4: What does the Pareto principle mean in the context of this analysis?**
  - A4: The Pareto principle, or 80/20 rule, suggests that a small percentage of SKUs (about 20%) contribute to a large portion of total revenue (around 80%), highlighting the need to focus on high-performing products.

- **Q5: Why is managing outliers important in data visualization?**
  - A5: Outliers can distort the overall picture in visualizations, making it difficult to interpret data correctly. Cleaning outlier data helps present a more accurate and clear analysis.

### Core Concepts

- **Data Integration**: The process of merging different data sources (like SKU pricing and sales data) is crucial for accurate analysis. Using Excel functions such as VLOOKUP facilitates this integration.
