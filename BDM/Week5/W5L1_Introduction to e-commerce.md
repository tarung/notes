# Introduction to E-commerce

## Overview

- E-commerce in India has grown rapidly, especially since the COVID-19 pandemic.
- Companies like Flipkart have played a major role in supporting the economy through logistics and home delivery.
- Despite high growth rates, e-commerce still represents a small percentage of total retail in India (single digits), with significant room for expansion, especially in tier 2 and 3 cities.

## Global Comparison

- China is a template for Indian e-commerce, with much higher market share (30–40%) and mass-market adoption.
- India is transitioning from niche to mass market, following Chinese trends more than US/Europe.
- The US and Europe have different e-commerce models, often less mass-market focused.

- Online platforms can track browsing, shopping, and cart history, allowing for targeted recommendations and merchandising.
- Offline retail lacks this level of customer data, except in small, relationship-driven stores.
- Data-driven decision making is central to modern e-commerce strategy.

## Key Points
