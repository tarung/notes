# Review of Data for E-commerce Case Study

## Overview of Provided Data

- The dataset consists of four main sheets:
  1. **SKU Master**: Contains 30 SKUs (10 mobiles, 10 FMCG, 10 lifestyle), each with brand, model, and price.
  2. **Sales Data**: Daily records of units shipped for each SKU from each DC (Hyderabad, Madras, Cochin) over 15 days.
  3. **Opening Stock**: The starting inventory for each SKU at each DC on the first day.
  4. **Stock Transfers**: Records of inventory moved from the central hub (Hyderabad) to forward DCs (Madras, Cochin).

## Key Insights

- SKUs are grouped by business unit: Mobiles (M), FMCG (F), Lifestyle (L).
- Prices vary widely, especially among mobiles (from ₹8,000 to ₹60,000+).
- High volume SKUs are likely to be FMCG; high revenue SKUs are likely to be mobiles.
- Frequency of purchase differs: FMCG is bought more often, mobiles less frequently.
- Sales data allows analysis of volume, revenue, and trends by SKU, DC, and date.
- Stock transfer data shows logistics between hub and forward DCs, typically via daily truck shipments.

## Practical Use

- The data supports analysis for inventory management, logistics planning, and business insights.
- Enables calculation of high volume/revenue SKUs, stock depletion, and fulfillment efficiency.

## Key Points

- Rich, structured data enables multi-dimensional analysis for e-commerce operations.
- Understanding SKU, sales, and logistics data is essential for effective business decision-making.
