# W6L2: Scatter Chart Presentation

## Glossary

1. **Scatter Plot**: A graph with points plotted to show the relationship between two variables.
2. **SKU (Stock Keeping Unit)**: Unique identifier for each product.
3. **Volume**: Number of units sold.
4. **Revenue**: Total income from sales.
5. **Outlier**: A data point that is significantly different from others.
6. **Fulfillment Center (FC)**: A warehouse where products are stored, packed, and shipped.
7. **Processing Area**: The section of an FC where orders are packed and dispatched.
8. **Storage Zone**: Area in an FC where products are kept before processing.
9. **Quadrant**: One of four sections of a scatter plot, used here to categorize SKUs by volume and revenue.
10. **High-Volume SKU**: Product that sells in large quantities.
11. **High-Value SKU**: Product that generates high revenue per unit.
12. **Secured Storage**: Special area for storing valuable items, often with extra security.
13. **Dock**: Area in an FC where goods are received or shipped.
14. **Picking**: The process of selecting items from storage to fulfill orders.
15. **Packing**: Preparing items for shipment to customers.
16. **Cost Efficiency**: Minimizing costs while maintaining effectiveness.
17. **Currency Formatting**: Displaying numbers as monetary values for readability.
18. **Commas in Numbers**: Formatting numbers with commas to improve readability.
19. **Data Visualization**: Using charts or graphs to represent data.
20. **Insight**: A clear understanding gained from data analysis.

## Structured Notes

### Introduction

- This session demonstrates how scatter plots can be used to analyze and organize SKUs in a fulfillment center (FC).
- Focus is on using volume and revenue data to optimize storage and picking strategies.

### Creating and Interpreting the Scatter Plot

- Plot volume (x-axis) vs. revenue (y-axis) for each SKU.
- Different product categories (e.g., lifestyle, mobile) are shown in different colors.
- Outliers (very high volume or revenue SKUs) can distort the chart; removing them reveals more useful patterns.

### Dividing the Scatter Plot into Quadrants

- Draw vertical and horizontal lines to divide the plot into four quadrants:
  - Right of vertical line: High-volume SKUs (fast movers).
  - Above horizontal line: High-value SKUs.
  - Quadrants help categorize SKUs for storage and security needs.

### Organizing the Fulfillment Center (FC)

- High-volume SKUs (right side) should be stored close to the processing area for efficient picking.
- High-value SKUs (top side) require secured storage, possibly with lock and key or caged pallets.
- Quadrant-based strategy:
  - Quadrant C: High-volume, high-value—close to dock and in secured storage.
  - Quadrant B: High-volume, lower value—close to processing area.
  - Quadrant A: Low-volume, high-value—secured storage, location less critical.
  - Quadrant D: Low-volume, low-value—can be stored anywhere with available space.
- This organization minimizes picking costs and improves efficiency.

### Practical Analogies

- The kitchen analogy: Store frequently used items (like salt) close to the stove (processing area), and valuable items (like cheese) in the fridge (secured storage).

### Data Formatting and Readability

- Use currency formatting and commas in numbers to improve readability and reduce errors.
- Always format source data for clarity before creating charts.

### Key Insights

- Scatter plots reveal actionable patterns for warehouse organization.
- Quadrant analysis helps optimize storage, security, and picking efficiency.
- Proper data formatting aids in analysis and communication.

## Examples

- **Scatter Plot Setup:**
  - X-axis: Volume
  - Y-axis: Revenue
  - Series: Product categories
- **Quadrant Strategy:**
  - C: High-volume, high-value (secure, near dock)
  - B: High-volume, low-value (near processing)
  - A: Low-volume, high-value (secure, anywhere)
  - D: Low-volume, low-value (anywhere)
- **Formatting Example:**
  - Use currency and commas for numbers: 1,00,000 instead of 100000

## Key Points

- Use scatter plots to analyze SKU performance by volume and revenue.
- Organize FC storage based on quadrant analysis for efficiency and security.
- Format data for readability before analysis.
- Insights from data visualization can drive operational improvements.
