## Structured Notes

### Introduction

- This session demonstrates how scatter plots can be used to analyze and organize SKUs in a fulfillment center (FC).
- Focus is on using volume and revenue data to optimize storage and picking strategies.

### Creating and Interpreting the Scatter Plot

- Plot volume (x-axis) vs. revenue (y-axis) for each SKU.
- Different product categories (e.g., lifestyle, mobile) are shown in different colors.
- Outliers (very high volume or revenue SKUs) can distort the chart; removing them reveals more useful patterns.

### Dividing the Scatter Plot into Quadrants

- Draw vertical and horizontal lines to divide the plot into four quadrants:
  - Right of vertical line: High-volume SKUs (fast movers).
  - Above horizontal line: High-value SKUs.
  - Quadrants help categorize SKUs for storage and security needs.

### Organizing the Fulfillment Center (FC)

- High-volume SKUs (right side) should be stored close to the processing area for efficient picking.
- High-value SKUs (top side) require secured storage, possibly with lock and key or caged pallets.
- Quadrant-based strategy:
  - Quadrant C: High-volume, high-value—close to dock and in secured storage.
  - Quadrant B: High-volume, lower value—close to processing area.
  - Quadrant A: Low-volume, high-value—secured storage, location less critical.
  - Quadrant D: Low-volume, low-value—can be stored anywhere with available space.
- This organization minimizes picking costs and improves efficiency.

### Practical Analogies

- The kitchen analogy: Store frequently used items (like salt) close to the stove (processing area), and valuable items (like cheese) in the fridge (secured storage).

### Data Formatting and Readability

- Use currency formatting and commas in numbers to improve readability and reduce errors.
- Always format source data for clarity before creating charts.

### Key Insights

- Scatter plots reveal actionable patterns for warehouse organization.
- Quadrant analysis helps optimize storage, security, and picking efficiency.
- Proper data formatting aids in analysis and communication.

## Examples

- **Scatter Plot Setup:**
  - X-axis: Volume
  - Y-axis: Revenue
  - Series: Product categories
- **Quadrant Strategy:**
  - C: High-volume, high-value (secure, near dock)
  - B: High-volume, low-value (near processing)
  - A: Low-volume, high-value (secure, anywhere)
  - D: Low-volume, low-value (anywhere)
- **Formatting Example:**
  - Use currency and commas for numbers: 1,00,000 instead of 100000

---

## Key Points

- Use scatter plots to analyze SKU performance by volume and revenue.
- Organize FC storage based on quadrant analysis for efficiency and security.
- Format data for readability before analysis.
- Insights from data visualization can drive operational improvements.

The discussion revolves around organizing a Fulfillment Center (FC) effectively based on data analysis of Stock Keeping Units (SKUs). By utilizing a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between revenue and volume for various SKUs, the team identifies fast-moving items and high-value products. They propose storing fast-moving SKUs closer to the processing area for quicker access, while high-value items need secure storage. The conversation emphasizes the importance of data visualization in decision-making and the need for clear communication through data formatting.

### Highlights

- The scatter plot analysis reveals the distribution of revenue and volume among SKUs.
- Fast-moving SKUs should be stored near the processing area to enhance efficiency.
- High-value SKUs require secure storage to prevent loss and ensure safety.
- A clear delineation between SKUs is established using horizontal and vertical lines on the graph.
- The organization of the FC is categorized into four quadrants based on SKU characteristics.
- Effective communication of data, such as using commas for readability, is crucial in analysis.
- The insights gained from the scatter plot are deemed valuable for optimizing fulfillment strategies.

### Key Insights

- **Data Visualization is Key**: The use of scatter plots allows for a clearer understanding of SKU characteristics, which is essential for making informed decisions on storage.
  
- **Fast-Moving Items Management**: Items classified as fast movers should be placed near the packing area to minimize picking time and improve order fulfillment efficiency.
  
- **High-Value Item Security**: High-value SKUs necessitate special storage solutions, such as lockable areas or cage pallets, to mitigate the risk of theft and loss.
  
- **Quadrant Analysis**: The four-quadrant model helps categorize SKUs based on their movement rate and value, streamlining the organization of the FC.
  
- **Efficiency in Picking**: By strategically situating SKUs based on their characteristics, the FC can reduce the time spent retrieving items, leading to cost savings.
  
- **Importance of Readability in Data**: Clear formatting, such as using commas and currency symbols, enhances the readability of data, reducing errors in interpretation.
  
- **Synthesis of Data and Action**: The insights derived from data analysis must translate into actionable strategies within the FC to be effective.
