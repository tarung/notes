## Structured Notes

### Introduction

- This section provides background on the impact of COVID-19 and regulatory changes on the automotive sector, setting the stage for the ACE Gears case.

### COVID-19 Impact on Automotive Sector

- The pandemic caused a sharp decline in demand for automobiles due to reduced disposable income and willingness to buy.
- Lockdowns led to labor migration from manufacturing hubs to hometowns, disrupting production.
- Inventory built up in the value chain as demand dropped.
- When restrictions eased, production and demand spiked temporarily, especially during festive seasons.
- The industry experienced turbulence with multiple waves of the pandemic.

### Financial Year vs. Calendar Year

- Financial year in India: April 1 to March 31 (e.g., FY 2021 = April 1, 2020 to March 31, 2021).
- Calendar year: January 1 to December 31.
- Western companies often use the calendar year for reporting.

### Regulatory Changes: BS4 to BS6

- Bharat Stage (BS) emission norms regulate vehicle pollution in India.
- Transition from BS4 to BS6 involved stricter limits on hydrocarbons, NOx, and particulate matter.
- Example: NOx limit reduced from 250 mg/km (BS4) to 80 mg/km (BS6).
- These changes required manufacturers to upgrade technology and processes.

### Key Insights

- The automotive sector is highly sensitive to external shocks (pandemics, regulations).
- Supply chain and labor disruptions can have lasting effects on production and sales.
- Regulatory changes drive technological upgrades and impact industry planning.

The automotive sector has experienced significant challenges due to the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in 2020. Manufacturing shutdowns led to a decline in demand for vehicles, resulting in increased inventory levels. The migration of labor from manufacturing hubs hampered the industry's ability to recover quickly, causing disruptions in supply chains. The transition from BS4 to BS6 emission norms has also had substantial implications for manufacturers, as stricter regulations have necessitated changes in engine technology. Despite these challenges, the industry saw a rebound in demand during the latter half of 2020, particularly around festive seasons. Effective resource planning and management have become critical for manufacturers to adapt to changing market conditions.

### Highlights

- COVID-19 severely impacted the automotive sector, leading to manufacturing shutdowns and labor migration.
- Demand for new vehicles plummeted in the first half of FY 2021, causing inventory issues.
- The transition from BS4 to BS6 emission norms required significant technological adjustments in engine design.
- The automotive industry began to normalize in the latter half of 2020, with a surge in demand during festive seasons.
- Effective planning is essential in managing resources across various departments in automotive manufacturing.
- The financial year in India runs from April 1 to March 31, differing from the calendar year.
- A bill of materials outlines the hierarchical structure of components needed to produce finished automotive products.

### Key Insights
