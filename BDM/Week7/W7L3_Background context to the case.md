## Structured Notes

### Introduction

- This section provides background on the impact of COVID-19 and regulatory changes on the automotive sector, setting the stage for the ACE Gears case.

### COVID-19 Impact on Automotive Sector

- The pandemic caused a sharp decline in demand for automobiles due to reduced disposable income and willingness to buy.
- Lockdowns led to labor migration from manufacturing hubs to hometowns, disrupting production.
- Inventory built up in the value chain as demand dropped.
- When restrictions eased, production and demand spiked temporarily, especially during festive seasons.
- The industry experienced turbulence with multiple waves of the pandemic.

### Financial Year vs. Calendar Year

- Financial year in India: April 1 to March 31 (e.g., FY 2021 = April 1, 2020 to March 31, 2021).
- Calendar year: January 1 to December 31.
- Western companies often use the calendar year for reporting.

### Regulatory Changes: BS4 to BS6

- Bharat Stage (BS) emission norms regulate vehicle pollution in India.
- Transition from BS4 to BS6 involved stricter limits on hydrocarbons, NOx, and particulate matter.
- Example: NOx limit reduced from 250 mg/km (BS4) to 80 mg/km (BS6).
- These changes required manufacturers to upgrade technology and processes.

### Key Insights

- The automotive sector is highly sensitive to external shocks (pandemics, regulations).
- Supply chain and labor disruptions can have lasting effects on production and sales.
- Regulatory changes drive technological upgrades and impact industry planning.

## Examples

- **COVID-19 Impact:**
  - Sharp drop in car sales and production during lockdowns.
  - Labor shortages delayed factory restarts.
- **BS4 to BS6 Transition:**
  - Manufacturers had to reduce vehicle emissions and upgrade engines.
- **Financial Year Example:**
  - FY 2021: April 1, 2020 â€“ March 31, 2021.

## Key Points

- COVID-19 caused major disruptions in the automotive sector, affecting demand, supply, and labor.
- Regulatory changes like BS6 required significant industry adaptation.
- Understanding these contexts is crucial for analyzing manufacturing case studies.
