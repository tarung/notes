## Introduction

This lecture demonstrates the bottom-up approach to market sizing using actual survey data from the aspirational India dataset. Rather than making top-down assumptions, the analysis examines real customer responses to understand purchase intentions, ownership patterns, and market segmentation opportunities.

## Bottom-up Market Research Methodology

### Data-Driven Analysis Approach

#### Philosophy of Bottom-up Research

**Starting with Data**:

- **Objective examination**: Let data reveal patterns rather than imposing assumptions
- **Customer voice**: Direct survey responses from potential buyers
- **Behavioral insights**: Actual preferences and intentions rather than theoretical models
- **Market reality**: Understanding what customers actually do vs what they might do

**Avoiding Top-down Bias**:

- **Assumption independence**: Not letting preconceived notions influence analysis
- **Data integrity**: Accepting survey results even when they contradict expectations
- **Pattern recognition**: Identifying genuine trends in customer behavior
- **Validation through data**: Cross-checking insights across multiple data points

#### Aspirational India Dataset Analysis

**Survey Scope and Quality**:

- **Sample size**: 62 respondents (from 100 total)
- **Response rate**: 62% completion rate for vehicle ownership questions
- **Data cleaning**: Removal of -99 missing data codes

**Key Survey Questions Analyzed**:

1. **Current ownership**: How many two-wheelers do you own?
2. **Recent purchases**: Have you bought a two-wheeler in the last 6 months?
3. **Purchase intentions**: Will you buy a two-wheeler?
4. **Immediate timing**: Will you buy now?
