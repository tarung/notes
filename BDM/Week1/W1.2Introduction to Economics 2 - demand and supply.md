# W1.2 Introduction to Economics 2 - Demand and Supply

## Glossary

**Demand**: The quantity of a good or service that consumers are willing and able to purchase at different price levels.

**Demand Curve**: A graphical representation showing the relationship between price and quantity demanded, typically sloping downward from left to right.

**Demand Schedule**: A table showing the quantity of goods that consumers are willing to buy at different prices.

**Distribution**: In statistics, how values are spread or arranged across different categories or ranges.

**Equilibrium**: The point where supply and demand curves intersect, representing the price and quantity at which the market clears.

**Equilibrium Price**: The price at which the quantity demanded equals the quantity supplied, resulting in market balance.

**Equilibrium Quantity**: The amount of goods traded when the market is in equilibrium.

**Inferior Good**: A product for which demand decreases as consumer income increases, as people substitute it with superior alternatives.

**Law of Demand**: The economic principle that states when price increases, quantity demanded decreases, and vice versa, all other factors remaining constant.

**Market Clearing**: A situation where all goods that suppliers want to sell at a given price are purchased by buyers, with no shortage or surplus.

**Normal Good**: A product for which demand increases as consumer income increases.

**Step Function**: A mathematical function that changes value abruptly at certain points, appearing as a series of horizontal steps when graphed.

**Substitutes**: Goods that can replace each other in consumption, such as rice and wheat as food staples.

**Supply**: The quantity of a good or service that producers are willing and able to offer at different price levels.

**Supply Curve**: A graphical representation showing the relationship between price and quantity supplied, typically sloping upward from left to right.

**Uniform Distribution**: A statistical distribution where all values have equal probability of occurrence.

**Willingness to Pay**: The maximum amount a consumer is prepared to spend for a specific good or service.

## Introduction

This lecture builds upon the circular flow model by exploring the fundamental concepts of demand and supply that govern how markets function. We examine how individual consumer preferences aggregate into market demand and how this interacts with supply to determine prices.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Foundation: Individual Willingness to Pay

#### Single Customer Example

**Scenario**: Customer wants to buy a smartphone

- **Willingness to pay**: Maximum ₹8,000
- **Purchase behavior**:
  - Will buy if price ≤ ₹8,000
  - Will not buy if price > ₹8,000

#### Graphical Representation

**Step Function**:

- **X-axis**: Price (₹4,000, ₹5,000, ₹6,000, ₹7,000, ₹8,000, ₹9,000)
- **Y-axis**: Quantity sold (0, 1)
- **Pattern**: 1 phone sold below ₹8,000, 0 phones sold above ₹8,000

### 2. Building Market Demand

#### Multiple Customers

**Five Customer Example**:

- Customer 1: Willing to pay up to ₹8,000
- Customer 2: Willing to pay up to ₹7,000  
- Customer 3: Willing to pay up to ₹6,000
- Customer 4: Willing to pay up to ₹5,000
- Customer 5: Willing to pay up to ₹4,000

#### Aggregated Demand Function

**Price Ranges and Quantities**:

- **Below ₹4,000**: 5 customers buy (all customers)
- **₹4,000-₹5,000**: 4 customers buy (Customer 5 drops out)
- **₹5,000-₹6,000**: 3 customers buy (Customers 4,5 drop out)
- **₹6,000-₹7,000**: 2 customers buy (Customers 3,4,5 drop out)
- **₹7,000-₹8,000**: 1 customer buys (Only Customer 1 remains)
- **Above ₹8,000**: 0 customers buy (all drop out)

#### Smooth Demand Curve

**With Many Customers**:

- Individual step functions aggregate into smooth curves
- Distribution of willingness to pay determines curve shape
- **Uniform distribution**: Equal numbers at each price point
- **Other distributions**: Create different curve shapes

### 3. Demand for Divisible Goods

#### Wheat Example

Unlike phones (discrete items), wheat is divisible and purchased in quantities.

**Customer Budget Approach**:

- Customer allocates fixed budget for wheat (e.g., ₹200/month)
- **Price vs. Quantity purchased**:
  - ₹10/kg → 20 kg (₹200 ÷ ₹10)
  - ₹11/kg → 18 kg (₹200 ÷ ₹11)  
  - ₹12/kg → 16 kg (₹200 ÷ ₹12)
  - ₹15/kg → 13 kg (₹200 ÷ ₹15)

#### Demand Schedule

**Table Format**:

| Price (₹/kg) | Quantity (kg) |
|--------------|---------------|
| 10           | 20            |
| 11           | 18            |
| 12           | 16            |
| 13           | 15            |
| 14           | 14            |
| 15           | 13            |

#### Demand Curve Characteristics

**Key Properties**:

- **Downward sloping**: Higher prices → Lower quantities
- **Bidirectional reading**: Can analyze price increases or decreases
- **No inherent direction**: Movement along curve can go either way
- **Interpolation**: Smooth lines connect discrete points

### 4. Supply Side Analysis

#### Supplier Behavior

**Seller's Perspective**:

- Has 20 kg of wheat to potentially sell
- **Strategic thinking**: Hold some stock for potential price increases
- **Price vs. Willingness to sell**:
  - ₹10/kg → Sell only 13 kg (hold 7 kg for better prices)
  - ₹15/kg → Sell all 20 kg (good price, clear inventory)

#### Supply Curve

**Upward Sloping Pattern**:

- **Higher prices** → **Greater willingness to sell**
- **Lower prices** → **Hold more inventory**
- **Logic**: Opportunity cost of holding stock decreases as current prices rise

### 5. Market Equilibrium

#### Combining Demand and Supply

**Single Market Graph**:

- **Same price axis** for both demand and supply
- **Demand curve**: Downward sloping
- **Supply curve**: Upward sloping
- **Intersection point**: Market equilibrium

#### Price Movement Dynamics

**Disequilibrium Scenarios**:

**High Demand, Low Supply (Price = ₹11)**:

- Many customers want to buy
- Seller reluctant to sell much
- **Result**: Price pressure upward

**High Supply, Low Demand (Price = ₹14)**:

- Seller wants to sell large quantities
- Few customers willing to buy
- **Result**: Price pressure downward

#### Equilibrium Achievement

**Market Clearing**:

- **Equilibrium price**: ₹12.50/kg (approximately)
- **Equilibrium quantity**: 15-16 kg
- **Characteristics**:
  - All that sellers want to sell is purchased
  - All that buyers want to buy is available
  - No shortage or surplus
  - Market "clears"

### 6. Price Determination

#### Market Forces

**Key Insight**: Price is an outcome, not an input

- **Not set by individual sellers**: Multiple sellers cannot coordinate
- **Market determined**: Result of buyer-seller interactions
- **Dynamic process**: Adjusts based on supply and demand imbalances

#### Alternative Representations

**Flexibility in Graphing**:

- **Traditional**: Price (X-axis) vs. Quantity (Y-axis)
- **Alternative**: Quantity (X-axis) vs. Price (Y-axis)
- **Discount pricing**: Quantity-based pricing strategies
- **Same relationship**: Mathematical relationship remains constant

### 7. Income Effects on Demand

#### Normal Goods Behavior

**Higher Income Impact**:

- **Increased purchasing power**: Larger budget for goods
- **Outward shift**: Demand curve moves right
- **Same price, higher quantity**: More goods purchased at each price level

**Example**:

- **Low income customer**: 15 kg wheat at ₹12/kg
- **High income customer**: 16 kg wheat at ₹12/kg
- **Pattern**: Higher income → higher demand at all price levels

#### Inferior Goods

**Substitution Effect**:

- **When income rises**: Switch to preferred alternatives
- **Example**: Wheat → Rice substitution
  - Lower income: Buy wheat (cheaper option)
  - Higher income: Switch to rice (preferred option)

**Curve Behavior**:

- **Inward shift**: Higher income reduces demand for inferior good
- **Opposite pattern**: Higher income → lower demand

#### Practical Implications

**Market Analysis**:

- **Identify good type**: Normal vs. inferior
- **Income trends**: Rising incomes affect different goods differently
- **Substitution patterns**: Understanding consumer preferences
- **Policy implications**: Income distribution affects market demand

### 8. Market Dynamics Summary

#### Key Relationships

**Demand Side**:

- **Price ↑ → Quantity demanded ↓**
- **Income ↑ → Demand ↑** (normal goods)
- **Income ↑ → Demand ↓** (inferior goods)

**Supply Side**:

- **Price ↑ → Quantity supplied ↑**
- **Inventory considerations**: Strategic holding decisions

**Market Equilibrium**:

- **Intersection of curves**: Determines price and quantity
- **Self-correcting mechanism**: Prices adjust to clear markets
- **Dynamic process**: Continuous adjustment to changing conditions

## Applications

## Summary

The demand and supply model provides the microeconomic foundation for the circular flow model. Key insights include:

1. **Individual preferences aggregate** into market demand curves
2. **Supplier behavior** creates upward-sloping supply curves  
3. **Market equilibrium** emerges from the intersection of demand and supply
4. **Prices are outcomes** of market forces, not arbitrary decisions
5. **Income effects** differentiate between normal and inferior goods
6. **Market dynamics** create self-correcting price mechanisms

This framework provides the analytical foundation for understanding market behavior, pricing strategies, and economic data interpretation in business contexts.
