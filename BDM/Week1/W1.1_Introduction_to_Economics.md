# W1.1 Introduction to Economics – Economic Flow

## Overview

This lecture introduces **basic concepts of economics**, particularly focusing on:

- Why economics is important for business and data analysis.
- How economic models help interpret real-world data.
- The concept of **trade, value creation, and circular flow** in economics.
- Role of households, firms, markets, and government in the economy.

---

## 1. Why Study Economics?

- Companies generate large amounts of **financial and operational data**.  
- To make sense of this data, we need **models**, and most of these models come from economics.  
- Economics helps us understand:
  - **Consumption patterns** and their relationship with price, inflation, etc.  
  - **Trade of goods and services** and what the information implies.  

**Analogy with Physics:**  

- Just as physics builds models of the physical world using mathematics (e.g., `F = ma`),  
- Economics builds models of the **economic world** using mathematics (e.g., supply & demand).  

---

## 2. Trade Creates Value

- Example: **Punjab** (excess wheat) and **Tamil Nadu** (excess phones).  
- Without trade:
  - Punjab’s excess wheat has little local value.  
  - Tamil Nadu’s excess phones quickly lose value (technology changes).  
- With trade (barter or money-based):  
  - Punjab exports wheat → Tamil Nadu gains value.  
  - Tamil Nadu exports phones → Punjab gains value.  

**Key Idea:** Exchange creates **mutual value** even though no new goods are produced.  

---

## 3. From Barter to Money

- In the past: direct barter (`wheat ↔ phones`).  
- Today: trade is facilitated through **currency** (rupees).  
- Currency in India is issued by the **Reserve Bank of India (RBI)**.  

**Flow Example:**  

- Punjab sells wheat → gets rupees.  
- Punjab buys phones → gives rupees back.  
- Thus, money circulates along with goods and services.  

---

## 4. Producers and Consumers

- Producers (Punjab wheat farmers, Tamil Nadu phone manufacturers).  
- Consumers (people in each state).  
- Better to think of **all producers** and **all consumers**, not just regions.  

**Circular Flow Expansion:**  

- Producers need **land, labor, and capital** from households.  
- Households provide these and earn **rent, wages, and interest**.  
- With this income, households buy goods and services.  

---

## 5. Households vs Individuals

- Consumption is often at the **household level**, not the individual level.  
- Example: buying wheat, sugar, rent, etc. shared across family members.  
- Surveys typically collect data **household by household**.  

---

## 6. Role of Intermediaries (Firms)

- Households don’t usually buy directly from producers.  
- **Firms and intermediaries** include:
  - **Retailers, wholesalers, distributors**  
  - **Banks, financial institutions**  
  - **Staffing companies**  
- Collectively called **firms**.  

---

## 7. Supply Chains and Value Chains

- A single product (e.g., a car) involves many **specialized firms**:  
  - Engine makers, tire companies, seat manufacturers, electronics suppliers, etc.  
- Supply chain includes raw materials like **steel, rubber, glass, plastic**.  
- All firms are interconnected in a **value creation process**.  

---

## 8. The Circular Flow Model

- Simplifies the economy into two main players:
  - **Households** → provide factors of production (land, labor, capital).  
  - **Firms** → provide goods & services.  
- Two types of markets:
  - **Product markets** → where goods & services are exchanged.  
  - **Resource markets** → where labor, land, and capital are provided.  

This creates the **circular flow of money and resources**.  

---

## 9. Role of Government

- Government regulates economic activity:  
  - Licensing, compliance, quality control.  
  - Provides **public goods** (roads, electricity, IT parks).  
  - Gives **incentives** (like India’s PLI scheme).  
  - Provides **subsidies and transfers** (e.g., DBT, ration system).  
- Collects taxes:
  - **GST (Goods & Services Tax)** on sales.  
  - **Income tax** on profits.  

**Government as Producer & Consumer:**  

- Runs **public enterprises** (SBI, BSNL, IOC, defense manufacturing).  
- Is also a major **consumer** (defense, offices, public works).  

---

## 10. Summary

- Economics provides models to interpret business and national data.  
- **Trade creates value** by moving goods from low-value to high-value contexts.  
- **Households and firms** are central, connected through **product & resource markets**.  
- **Government** regulates, produces, consumes, taxes, and redistributes.  
- This framework is the foundation of the **circular flow model**.  

---

## Glossary

- **Barter:** Direct exchange of goods/services without money.  
- **Circular Flow Model:** Diagram showing interaction of households, firms, and government.  
- **Factors of Production:** Land, labor, capital used to produce goods/services.  
- **Public Goods:** Services provided by government for collective use (roads, defense).  
- **Value Creation:** Increase in utility when goods move to where they are valued more.

## Self-Check Questions

1. Why is trade considered to create value?  
2. How does the circular flow model explain income and expenditure?  
3. Why are households considered the unit of consumption in economic models?  
4. What role do intermediaries (firms) play in connecting producers and consumers?  
5. How does the government participate in the economy as producer, consumer, and regulator?

# W1.2 Introduction to Economics – Demand and Supply

## Overview

This lecture introduces the **Law of Demand and Supply**, explaining how buyers and sellers interact in markets to determine prices and quantities.  
Key ideas include:  

- Demand: customer willingness to pay.  
- Supply: producer willingness to sell.  
- Market equilibrium: the point where demand and supply meet.  
- Impact of income and the concept of **normal vs inferior goods**.

---

## 1. Recap: Circular Flow

- Households provide land, labor, and capital via **resource markets**.  
- Firms provide goods and services via **product markets**.  
- Money circulates between households and firms → the **circular flow model**.

---

## 2. Demand: Willingness to Pay

- Example: A customer is willing to pay up to **₹8,000** for a smartphone.  
  - Price ≤ ₹8,000 → buy.  
  - Price > ₹8,000 → no purchase.  
- Graph: step function (1 if ≤ ₹8,000, 0 otherwise).  

When multiple customers are aggregated:  

- Each has different **willingness to pay** (₹4,000, ₹5,000, ₹6,000, etc.).  
- Aggregating these creates a **demand curve**.  
- As more customers are added, curve becomes smoother → downward sloping.  

---

## 3. Demand Schedule (Continuous Goods)

- For divisible goods like **wheat**:  
  - At ₹10/kg → demand = 20 kg.  
  - At ₹11/kg → demand = 18 kg.  
  - At ₹12/kg → demand = 16 kg.  
- Pattern: As **price increases, quantity demanded decreases**.  

**Law of Demand:** When price rises, demand falls; when price falls, demand rises.

---

## 4. Supply: Willingness to Sell

- Sellers also make decisions based on price.  
- Example: A wheat seller with 20 kg:  
  - At ₹15/kg → sells all 20 kg.  
  - At ₹10/kg → sells only 13 kg, keeps the rest (hoping for higher prices later).  
- Pattern: As **price increases, quantity supplied increases**.

**Law of Supply:** Higher prices encourage producers to supply more.  

---

## 5. Market Equilibrium

- Plot demand and supply on the same graph.  
- Intersection → **Equilibrium Price (P\*) and Quantity (Q\*)**.  
- Example:  
  - Equilibrium between ₹12–₹13/kg.  
  - Quantity equilibrium = 15–16 kg.  

At equilibrium:  

- Buyers get the quantity they want at that price.  
- Sellers sell exactly what they brought to the market.  
- **No shortage, no surplus.**  

---

## 6. Price Adjustment Mechanism

- If price < equilibrium → excess demand (shortage). Sellers raise prices.  
- If price > equilibrium → excess supply (surplus). Sellers lower prices.  
- Market self-corrects to equilibrium.

---

## 7. Alternative View of Price

- Price can be seen as an **outcome** of demand and supply, not predetermined.  
- Can plot:  
  - Price on X-axis, Quantity on Y-axis.  
  - Or Quantity on X-axis, Price on Y-axis.  
- Analysis is the same either way.  

Also linked to **discount pricing**:  

- Example: Buy 20 kg at ₹10/kg, but if buying only 13 kg → ₹15/kg.  

---

## 8. Impact of Income

- **Higher income** → demand curve shifts **outward**.  
- High-income customers buy **more at the same price** than low-income customers.  

### Normal vs Inferior Goods

- **Normal good:** Income ↑ → demand ↑ (e.g., electronics).  
- **Inferior good:** Income ↑ → demand ↓ (customers switch to substitutes).  
  - Example: If higher income leads to switching from **wheat → rice**, then wheat is considered an inferior good relative to rice.  

---

## 9. Key Takeaways

- Demand: willingness to pay → downward sloping.  
- Supply: willingness to sell → upward sloping.  
- Equilibrium: where demand = supply → market clears.  
- Price adjusts dynamically to balance shortages/surpluses.  
- Income shifts demand curve; must distinguish **normal vs inferior goods**.

---

## Glossary

- **Demand Curve:** Relationship between price and quantity demanded.  
- **Supply Curve:** Relationship between price and quantity supplied.  
- **Equilibrium Price (P\*):** Price at which demand = supply.  
- **Normal Good:** Demand rises with income.  
- **Inferior Good:** Demand falls with income as customers switch to better alternatives.  

---

## Self-Check Questions

1. What is the difference between demand and willingness to pay?  
2. Why does the supply curve slope upward?  
3. How is equilibrium price determined in a market?  
4. Explain the difference between normal and inferior goods with examples.  
5. Why does price act as an outcome of market forces?
