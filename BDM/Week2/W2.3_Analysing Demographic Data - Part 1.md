## Introduction

This lecture demonstrates practical data analysis techniques using Excel to explore demographic patterns in the CMIE dataset. The focus is on creating visual representations and calculating meaningful statistics to understand Indian household structures and consumption behaviors.

## Visual Data Analysis Techniques

### Creating Pie Charts for Household Size

#### Data Preparation Process

**Step 1: Extract Unique Values**

- **Method**: Excel Advanced Filter → Copy to another location
- **Purpose**: Get unique household size categories (1 member, 2 members, etc.)
- **Data Source**: Size group column (W2:W101)
- **Result**: Clean list without duplicates or "data not available" entries

**Step 2: Count Frequencies**

- **Function Used**: `=COUNTIF(main.W$2:W$101, criteria_cell)`
- **Purpose**: Count occurrences of each household size
- **Absolute Addressing**: Using $ signs to prevent cell reference changes when copying

**Step 3: Calculate Percentages**

- **Formula**: `=count_value/total_count`
- **Formatting**: Convert to percentage format
- **Purpose**: Show relative distribution of household sizes

#### Household Size Distribution Results

**Family Size Patterns** (from 100-household sample):

- **4 members**: 37% (most common family size)
- **5 members**: 24% (second most common)
- **3 members**: 19% (nuclear families)
- **2 members**: 14% (couples or small families)
- **1 member**: 1.6% (very few single-person households)
- **6+ members**: 4.4% (joint families, less common)

**Key Insights**:

- **Average household size**: 3-5 members (middle-class norm)
- **Distribution pattern**: Resembles Gaussian distribution with peak at 4 members
- **Joint families**: Declining trend, less than 5% above 6 members
- **Single living**: Very rare, indicating family-oriented society

### Comparative Chart Analysis

#### Pie Chart vs Bar Chart Effectiveness

**Pie Chart Advantages**:

- **Proportional clarity**: Shows percentage share of each category
- **Visual impact**: Immediate understanding of largest segments
- **Presentation value**: Professional appearance for reports

**Bar Chart Advantages**:

- **Distribution pattern**: Reveals Gaussian (bell-curve) distribution clearly
- **Comparative ease**: Better for comparing similar-sized categories
- **Trend visualization**: Shows peaks and valleys in data distribution

#### Age Group Analysis Across Datasets

**Consumption Data Age Groups**:

- **Grown-up dominant**: 25% (largest category)
- **Balanced household with no seniors**: Major segment
- **Senior dominant**: Only 2% (aging population underrepresented)
- **Youngsters dominant**: 5% (young professionals)

**Aspirational Data Age Groups**:

- **Balanced households with seniors**: Higher representation
- **Different sampling**: Shows variation between datasets
- **Consistency check**: Similar patterns but different proportions

**Data Quality Assessment**:

- **Sampling differences**: Expected variation between survey waves
- **Pattern consistency**: Overall distributions follow similar trends
- **Validation purpose**: Cross-dataset comparison ensures reliability

## Consumption Pattern Analysis

### Food Expenditure Analysis

#### Rural vs Urban Food Consumption

**Overall Food Expenditure**: 41% of total household spending

**Rural Households**:

- **Food expenditure**: 44% of total consumption
- **Higher dependency**: Greater reliance on food purchases
- **Economic constraint**: Limited discretionary spending

**Urban Households**:

- **Food expenditure**: 39% of total consumption
- **Diversified spending**: More categories beyond basic needs
- **Higher income**: More non-food expenditure options

#### Calculation Methodology

**Two Approaches Compared**:

1. **Weighted Average Method**: `Sum(food_expenses)/Sum(total_expenses)`
   - **Result**: 41% overall
   - **Logic**: Total food expenditure divided by total expenditure

2. **Simple Average Method**: `Average(individual_percentages)`
   - **Result**: 44% overall
   - **Logic**: Average of each household's food percentage

**Mathematical Difference**:

- **Formula**: (A+B)/(C+D) ≠ (A/C + B/D)/2
- **Explanation**: Weighted average accounts for household size differences
- **Preference**: Weighted average more representative of population

### Detailed Consumption Categories

#### Food Sub-categories (Rural Analysis)

**Staple Foods**:

- **Cereals and pulses**: 11% of total expenditure (25% of food budget)
- **Milk and milk products**: 9% of total expenditure (20% of food budget)
- **Basic necessities**: Together account for 45% of food spending

**Processed Foods**:

- **Bread and processed cereals**: Moderate expenditure
- **Traditional sweets**: Regional variation expected
- **Modern snacks**: Growing adoption in rural areas

#### Non-Food Major Categories

**Intoxicants**:

- **Rural expenditure**: 5% of total consumption
- **Urban expenditure**: 3% of total consumption
- **Rural preference**: Higher tobacco and alcohol consumption
- **Components**: Tobacco, betel nuts, alcohol, cigarettes

**Transportation**:

- **Rural expenditure**: 4% of total consumption
- **Urban expenditure**: 2% of total consumption
- **Absolute amounts**: Rural ₹404/month vs Urban ₹266/month

#### Transportation Analysis Deep Dive

**Rural Transportation Patterns**:

- **Higher percentage**: 4% vs 2% urban
- **Higher absolute spending**: ₹404 vs ₹266 monthly
- **Bimodal distribution**: Some spend heavily, others spend nothing

**Occupation-based Transportation**:

- **High spenders**: Industrial workers, organized farmers
- **Zero spenders**: Small/marginal farmers, agricultural laborers
- **Distance factor**: Rural workers often travel to urban areas for employment

**Low Transport Households** (≤₹400/month):

- **Occupations**: Small/marginal farmers, wage laborers
- **Pattern**: Work locally, minimal travel needs
- **Economic constraint**: Cannot afford regular transportation

**High Transport Households** (≥₹400/month):

- **Occupations**: Industrial workers, organized farmers
- **Pattern**: 6% of income on transportation
- **Economic necessity**: Travel for better employment opportunities

## Advanced Excel Analysis Techniques

### Subtotal Function for Dynamic Analysis

#### Setting Up Dynamic Calculations

**Formula Structure**:

- **Function**: `=SUBTOTAL(109, range)` for sum
- **Advantage**: Automatically adjusts when filters are applied
- **Use case**: Calculate totals for filtered subsets

**Implementation Process**:

1. **Insert percentage column**: Calculate individual household percentages
2. **Add subtotal formulas**: Use SUBTOTAL function for sums
3. **Apply filters**: Urban/rural or other demographic filters
4. **Automatic recalculation**: Percentages update automatically
