This lecture, part of the Machine Learning Foundations course, focuses on the concept of projections in linear algebra and their crucial role in solving least squares problems. The key objective is to understand projections not just onto a line but onto a subspace, specifically the column space of a matrix, and how this relates to finding approximate solutions to inconsistent systems of linear equations through least squares minimization.

The lecture begins by revisiting the basic least squares problem in a one-dimensional setting, where you have a system of equations like 2x = b₁, 3x = b₂, 4x = b₃. Such a system is solvable only if the vector b = (b₁, b₂, b₃) lies exactly on the line spanned by the vector (2, 3, 4). However, in real-world applications, data is often noisy, making the system inconsistent and unsolvable in the exact sense. The natural question is how to find a meaningful approximate solution in these cases.

The lecture highlights that simply discarding some equations to solve a subset exactly can lead to large errors in the discarded data points. Instead, a more reasonable approach is to minimize the average error across all data points. This is done by minimizing the sum of squared errors, which gives the method its name: least squares. For the one-dimensional example, this involves minimizing the function E = (2x - b₁)² + (3x - b₂)² + (4x - b₃)².

Using calculus, the derivative of E with respect to x is set to zero to find the optimal x̂ (x-hat). This leads to a formula for the least squares solution that can be expressed as x̂ = (2b₁ + 3b₂ + 4b₃) / (2² + 3² + 4²). This expression resembles the formula for projecting a vector onto another vector (or line), hinting at the deeper connection between least squares solutions and projections.

### Core Concepts

The central insight is that solving a least squares problem is equivalent to projecting the vector b onto the column space of the matrix A representing the system. Projection is essentially the operation of finding the closest vector in a subspace (here, the column space of A) to the vector b. The lecture then extends the idea from projection onto a line to projection onto a general subspace.

For a system of the form Ax = b, where A is an m-by-n matrix (m equations, n unknowns), the goal is to find the projection p of b onto the column space of A. The projection vector p can be expressed as p = A x̂ for some vector x̂. The error vector e = b - p is orthogonal to every vector in the column space of A, meaning that the residual e lies in the null space of Aᵀ (the orthogonal complement of the column space).

This orthogonality condition leads to the fundamental equation for finding x̂:

**Aᵀ A x̂ = Aᵀ b**

This equation is known as the normal equation. It always has a solution even when the original system Ax = b has no exact solution (i.e., when b is not in the column space of A). Solving this equation yields x̂, which minimizes the squared error ‖Ax - b‖².

### Orthogonal Complements and Least Squares

The lecture explains the concept of orthogonal complements, emphasizing that the null space of Aᵀ is the orthogonal complement of the column space of A. Since the error vector e is orthogonal to the column space of A, it must lie in the null space of Aᵀ. This condition provides the key to deriving the normal equation.

An alternative derivation starts from first principles by noting that the vector e must be orthogonal to every column of A individually. By expressing this orthogonality for each column vector aᵢ, and stacking these conditions, the same normal equation emerges.

### Properties of the Projection Matrix

Once the least squares solution x̂ is found, the projection of b onto the column space of A can be written using a projection matrix P:

**P = A (Aᵀ A)⁻¹ Aᵀ**

This matrix P has two important properties:

1. **Symmetry:** Pᵀ = P
2. **Idempotency:** P² = P

These two properties uniquely characterize projection matrices. The lecture also states the converse: any matrix that is symmetric and idempotent is a projection matrix onto some subspace.

### Special Cases and Intuition

Several special cases help illustrate the concepts:

- If the columns of A are linearly independent (full column rank), then Aᵀ A is invertible, and the normal equation can be solved uniquely.
- If b is already in the column space of A, projecting b onto that column space returns b unchanged.
- If b lies in the null space of Aᵀ (orthogonal complement of the column space), then the projection is the zero vector.
- If A is a square invertible matrix (full rank and square), the projection matrix P reduces to the identity matrix, so projecting any vector b returns b itself.
- If A is rank one (a single column vector), the general formula reduces to the simple projection formula onto a line, consistent with the one-dimensional case discussed earlier.

### Summary and Closing Remarks

The lecture concludes by summarizing the key outcomes:

- The least squares problem can be solved either by calculus (taking derivatives to find minima) or by projection (onto the column space of A).
- Projection matrices play a central role in understanding least squares solutions. They are symmetric and idempotent, and their structure encodes the geometry of the problem.
- Even when the original system Ax = b is inconsistent, the system Aᵀ A x̂ = Aᵀ b is always solvable, providing the best approximate solution in the least squares sense.
- The connection between projections and least squares provides a powerful geometric and algebraic understanding of how to handle noisy or inconsistent data.

The next lecture will build on this foundation by solving a concrete example of a least squares problem using the projection approach, reinforcing the concepts learned here.

This lecture, the fifth in the third week of the Machine Learning Foundations course, focuses on the concept of least squares and projections within the context of linear algebra. The main objective is to understand how to solve least squares problems, particularly when given a system of linear equations that may be inconsistent, and how projections help in finding approximate solutions.

The motivation behind this topic is a classic problem in data fitting — curve fitting. Specifically, the lecture examines how to fit a straight line to a set of data points using the least squares method. This is framed as solving a linear system \( A\theta = b \), where \( A \) contains the input data, \( \theta \) represents the parameters (slope and intercept) of the line, and \( b \) contains the output data points.

The lecture begins by setting up the problem: given a set of data points \((x_i, b_i)\) for \(i=1, \dots, m\), the goal is to find parameters \( \theta = [\theta', \theta'']^T \) such that the line \( y = \theta' x + \theta'' \) best fits the data. However, this system \( A\theta = b \) may not always have an exact solution because the points may not lie perfectly on a line, rendering the system inconsistent.

To address this, the least squares approach is introduced, which minimizes the squared error between the observed data \( b \) and the predicted values \( A\theta \). This leads to the optimization problem:

\[
\hat{\theta} = \arg\min_\theta \|b - A\theta\|^2
\]

where the solution \(\hat{\theta}\) provides the best linear fit in the least squares sense.

A graphical explanation helps to understand the geometric intuition behind least squares: the data points \( b \) can be seen as vectors in a higher-dimensional space, and the goal is to find a projection \( P \) of \( b \) onto the column space of \( A \), minimizing the distance (error vector \( e = b - P \)) between \( b \) and \( P \). If the points already lie on a line, the projection perfectly matches the data, and the error is zero; otherwise, the error is minimized but non-zero.

The lecture then proceeds with a concrete numerical example to solidify understanding. The example involves a system where:

\[
A = \begin{bmatrix} -1 & 1 \\ 2 & 1 \\ 1 & 1 \end{bmatrix}, \quad b = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \\ 3 \end{bmatrix}
\]

The first step is to check if the system is consistent by determining if \( b \) lies in the column space of \( A \). This is done through Gaussian elimination to check solvability. The system is found to be inconsistent, meaning no exact solution exists.

To find the best approximate solution, the least squares normal equations are formed:

\[
A^T A \hat{\theta} = A^T b
\]

where \( A^T \) is the transpose of \( A \). The matrices are computed as:

\[
A^T A = \begin{bmatrix} 6 & 2 \\ 2 & 3 \end{bmatrix}, \quad A^T b = \begin{bmatrix} 6 \\ 5 \end{bmatrix}
\]

Solving this simultaneous system yields the least squares parameters:

\[
\hat{\theta} = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{4}{7} \\ \frac{9}{7} \end{bmatrix}
\]

Thus, the best fit line in the least squares sense is:

\[
y = \frac{4}{7} x + \frac{9}{7}
\]

Using this line, the projection points \( P_i = A_i \hat{\theta} \) are computed for each input \( x_i \), yielding approximate \( y \)-values on the fitted line:

- For \( x = -1 \), the projection is \( \frac{5}{7} \)
- For \( x = 1 \), the projection is \( \frac{13}{7} \)
- For \( x = 2 \), the projection is \( \frac{17}{7} \)

Since the original points do not lie on the fitted line, there is a non-zero residual vector \( e = b - A\hat{\theta} \), which represents the error or the distance from the data points to the fitted line.

The lecture calculates this error vector explicitly as:

\[
e = \begin{bmatrix} 1 - \frac{5}{7} \\ 1 - \frac{13}{7} \\ 3 - \frac{17}{7} \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{2}{7} \\ -\frac{6}{7} \\ \frac{4}{7} \end{bmatrix}
\]

A key insight is that this residual vector \( e \) is orthogonal to the column space of \( A \). Geometrically, this means the error vector is perpendicular to the space spanned by the columns of \( A \), which represents the space of all possible predictions by the linear model. This orthogonality condition characterizes the least squares solution and is fundamental to understanding projections in linear algebra.

The lecture emphasizes the importance of verifying whether a system is consistent before attempting least squares regression since if the system is consistent (i.e., data points lie exactly on the line), the least squares solution coincides with the exact solution. Otherwise, the least squares solution provides the best possible fit by minimizing the total squared error.

Before concluding, the instructor summarizes the key takeaways:

- Least squares regression can be understood as projecting the observed data vector \( b \) onto the column space of the design matrix \( A \).
- The solution minimizes the sum of squared differences between observed and predicted values.
- The residual error vector is orthogonal to the column space of \( A \).
- The method is foundational for linear regression, the simplest and most widely used model in machine learning.

Finally, the lecture sets the stage for the next lecture, which will generalize these ideas to multi-dimensional cases where the projection is onto a subspace of higher dimension rather than just a line. This will encompass general linear regression models, broadening the scope beyond the simple univariate linear fit discussed here.

### Notes

This lecture, part of a machine learning foundations course in week 4, focuses on fundamental linear algebra concepts crucial for understanding various machine learning methods: eigenvalues and eigenvectors. It introduces these concepts from first principles, emphasizing their importance in solving ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and setting the stage for more advanced topics such as eigenvalue decomposition, singular value decomposition (SVD), and principal component analysis (PCA).

The lecture begins by motivating the discussion with a system of linear ODEs. The problem is framed as solving \( \frac{d\mathbf{u}}{dt} = A \mathbf{u} \), where \( \mathbf{u} \) is a vector and \( A \) is a coefficient matrix. The solution to this system naturally leads to the eigenvalue equation \( A \mathbf{x} = \lambda \mathbf{x} \), where \( \lambda \) is an eigenvalue and \( \mathbf{x} \) the corresponding eigenvector. The lecture explains that finding solutions to such ODEs is equivalent to solving this eigenvalue problem. This connection provides the initial motivation for the study of eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

An eigenvalue \( \lambda \) and eigenvector \( \mathbf{x} \) satisfy the equation \( A \mathbf{x} = \lambda \mathbf{x} \), meaning when a matrix \( A \) acts on \( \mathbf{x} \), it only stretches or shrinks \( \mathbf{x} \) without changing its direction. The lecture also notes the special case \( \lambda = 0 \), where the eigenvector lies in the null space of \( A \).

Several illustrative examples help build intuition. The first example is a projection matrix \( P \) projecting onto a plane. For vectors in the plane, \( P \mathbf{x} = \mathbf{x} \), so \( \lambda = 1 \) with eigenvectors lying in the plane. For vectors perpendicular to the plane, the projection is zero, so \( \lambda = 0 \) is another eigenvalue with eigenvectors perpendicular to the plane. This simple case demonstrates how eigenvalues and eigenvectors capture geometric transformations.

The second example is a permutation matrix, which is formed by shuffling the rows of the identity matrix. The eigenvalues and eigenvectors can be found by inspection: for the given permutation matrix, \( \mathbf{x} = (1,1) \) is an eigenvector with eigenvalue 1, and \( \mathbf{x} = (1,-1) \) is an eigenvector with eigenvalue -1. These examples encourage the viewer to pause and think before revealing solutions, reinforcing intuition.

The lecture then outlines the systematic procedure for finding eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Starting from the eigenvalue equation \( A \mathbf{x} = \lambda \mathbf{x} \), it is rewritten as \( (A - \lambda I) \mathbf{x} = 0 \). For a non-trivial solution \( \mathbf{x} \neq 0 \), the matrix \( A - \lambda I \) must be singular, meaning its determinant is zero. The determinant equation \( \det(A - \lambda I) = 0 \) is called the characteristic polynomial of \( A \). For an \( n \times n \) matrix, the characteristic polynomial has degree \( n \), and its roots are the eigenvalues. Once eigenvalues are found, eigenvectors are obtained by solving \( (A - \lambda I) \mathbf{x} = 0 \) via Gaussian elimination or other linear algebra methods.

A concrete example with a \( 2 \times 2 \) symmetric matrix \( A = \begin{bmatrix} 3 & 1 \\ 1 & 3 \end{bmatrix} \) is analyzed. The characteristic polynomial is \( \lambda^2 - 6\lambda + 8 = 0 \), yielding eigenvalues 4 and 2. The eigenvectors corresponding to these eigenvalues are \( (1,1) \) and \( (1,-1) \), respectively. This example also introduces the trace of a matrix (sum of diagonal elements) as equal to the sum of eigenvalues and the determinant as equal to the product of eigenvalues, providing useful relationships.

The lecture discusses variations of the matrix \( A \) and poses a thought exercise: if \( B = A - 3I \), then the eigenvectors of \( B \) are the same as those of \( A \), but with eigenvalues shifted by 3. This encourages deeper understanding of eigenvalues under matrix transformations.

However, the lecture warns against simplistic assumptions about eigenvalues and eigenvectors under matrix addition. Specifically, if \( A \mathbf{x}_1 = \lambda_1 \mathbf{x}_1 \) and \( B \mathbf{x}_2 = \lambda_2 \mathbf{x}_2 \), it is generally not true that \( (A + B) \mathbf{x} = (\lambda_1 + \lambda_2) \mathbf{x} \) for the same vector \( \mathbf{x} \), because \( \mathbf{x}_1 \) and \( \mathbf{x}_2 \) need not be the same. This subtlety is important in understanding matrix algebra and eigenvalue decomposition.

The lecture also introduces matrices with non-real eigenvalues, using the example \( A = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \), whose characteristic polynomial yields eigenvalues \( i \) and \( -i \) (imaginary numbers). This example shows that eigenvalues need not always be real, especially for non-symmetric matrices.

Further, it covers the case where a matrix does not have enough linearly independent eigenvectors to diagonalize it. The example matrix \( A = \begin{bmatrix} 3 & 1 \\ 0 & 3 \end{bmatrix} \) has a repeated eigenvalue \( \lambda = 3 \), but only one eigenvector \( (1,0) \). This situation illustrates that not all matrices are diagonalizable, a crucial concept for subsequent lectures.

In summary, this lecture:

- Motivates eigenvalues and eigenvectors via linear ODEs.
- Defines eigenvalue and eigenvector formally.
- Demonstrates geometric interpretation.

A1: They provide a foundation for understanding linear transformations, dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA, and decompositions such as SVD, all critical in machine learning.

**Q2: How do eigenvalues relate to the stability of ODEs?**

### Notes

- ([00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKZUxnrLmRk&t=0s)) ### Summary of Lecture 3: Similarity and Diagonalization of Matrices

This lecture, part of the Machine Learning Foundations course, focuses on the fundamental concepts of similarity and diagonalization of matrices. The goal is to understand when a matrix can be diagonalized, the role of eigenvalues and eigenvectors in this process, and to build toward the spectral theorem, which states that any real symmetric matrix is diagonalizable. The lecture provides precise definitions, theoretical claims, proofs, illustrative examples, and important remarks about diagonalization.

---

### Core Concepts

#### 1. **Definition of Diagonalizability**

A square matrix \( A \) is said to be diagonalizable if there exists an invertible matrix \( S \) such that

\[
S^{-1} A S = \Lambda
\]

where \( \Lambda \) is a diagonal matrix. This means that \( A \) can be transformed via a similarity transformation into a diagonal matrix. The diagonal entries of \( \Lambda \) will be the eigenvalues of \( A \).

---

#### 2. **Relation to Eigenvectors**

The diagonalizability of a matrix \( A \) is closely tied to the number of linearly independent eigenvectors it possesses. Specifically:

- If \( A \) is an \( n \times n \) matrix and has \( n \) linearly independent eigenvectors \( \{x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n\} \), then \( A \) is diagonalizable.
- The matrix \( S \) in the similarity transformation is constructed by placing these eigenvectors as columns:

\[
S = [x_1 \quad x_2 \quad \cdots \quad x_n]
\]

Because the eigenvectors are linearly independent, \( S \) is invertible.

---

#### 3. **Key Theoretical Claim: Eigenvectors for Distinct Eigenvalues are Independent**

If a matrix \( A \) has distinct eigenvalues \( \lambda_1, \lambda_2, \ldots, \lambda_n \), then the corresponding eigenvectors are linearly independent. This is a crucial property that simplifies diagonalization since distinct eigenvalues guarantee diagonalizability.

---

#### 4. **Proof Sketch for Independence of Eigenvectors Corresponding to Distinct Eigenvalues**

Consider two eigenvectors \( x_1 \) and \( x_2 \) corresponding to distinct eigenvalues \( \lambda_1 \neq \lambda_2 \). Assume a linear combination

\[
c_1 x_1 + c_2 x_2 = 0
\]

Apply \( A \) on both sides:

\[
c_1 \lambda_1 x_1 + c_2 \lambda_2 x_2 = 0
\]

Subtract \( \lambda_2 \) times the original equation from the above:

\[
c_1 (\lambda_1 - \lambda_2) x_1 = 0
\]

Since \( \lambda_1 \neq \lambda_2 \) and \( x_1 \neq 0 \), it follows that \( c_1 = 0 \). By a similar argument, \( c_2 = 0 \), proving independence.

---

### Detailed Example

Given matrix:

\[
A = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 4 \\ 2 & 3 \end{bmatrix}
\]

- Find eigenvalues by solving the characteristic polynomial:

\[
\det(A - \lambda I) = (1-\lambda)(3-\lambda) - 8 = 0
\]

Roots are \( \lambda_1 = 5 \) and \( \lambda_2 = -1 \), which are distinct.

- Find eigenvectors for each eigenvalue:

For \( \lambda_1 = 5 \):

\[
(A - 5I) = \begin{bmatrix} -4 & 4 \\ 2 & -2 \end{bmatrix}
\]

The null space corresponds to vectors proportional to \(\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}\).

For \( \lambda_2 = -1 \):

\[
(A + I) = \begin{bmatrix} 2 & 4 \\ 2 & 4 \end{bmatrix}
\]

The null space corresponds to vectors proportional to \(\begin{bmatrix} -2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}\).

- Construct matrix \( S \) with eigenvectors as columns:

\[
S = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & -2 \\ 1 & 1 \end{bmatrix}
\]

- Diagonal matrix \( \Lambda \):

\[
\Lambda = \begin{bmatrix} 5 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix}
\]

- Verify diagonalization:

\[
S^{-1} A S = \Lambda
\]

This confirms \( A \) is diagonalizable.

---

### Remarks and Observations

#### 1. **Non-Uniqueness of \( S \)**

The matrix \( S \) is not unique because eigenvectors can be scaled by any non-zero constant and still be valid. For example, if \( x_1 \) is an eigenvector, then \( c x_1 \) (for any \( c \neq 0 \)) is also an eigenvector. This scaling freedom changes \( S \) but not the diagonal matrix \( \Lambda \).

---

#### 2. **Diagonal Matrix Contains Eigenvalues Only**

The diagonal entries of \( \Lambda \) are the eigenvalues of \( A \), and these are unique for a given matrix. The matrix \( S \) contains eigenvectors, which are not unique, but the set of eigenvalues is fixed.

---

#### 3. **Relation to Powers of Matrices**

If \( \lambda \) is an eigenvalue and \( x \) is an eigenvector of \( A \), then:

\[
A^k x = \lambda^k x
\]

for any positive integer \( k \). Consequently, the diagonalization extends naturally to powers of \( A \):

\[
S^{-1} A^k S = \Lambda^k
\]

This property is useful in computations involving powers of matrices, such as in iterative algorithms and differential equations.

---

#### 4. **Non-Diagonalizable Matrices**

Some matrices do not have enough linearly independent eigenvectors and hence are not diagonalizable. For example, if the geometric multiplicity (number of independent eigenvectors) is less than the algebraic multiplicity (multiplicity of the eigenvalue), diagonalization fails.

---

### Summary of the Lecture

- **Diagonalizability**: A matrix \( A \) is diagonalizable if there exists an invertible matrix \( S \) such that \( S^{-1} A S = \Lambda \), where \( \Lambda \) is diagonal.
- **Eigenvectors and Diagonalization**: \( A \) is diagonalizable if it has \( n \) linearly independent eigenvectors.
- **Distinct eigenvalues guarantee linear independence** of eigenvectors and thus diagonalizability.
- **Example**: A practical example of a \( 2 \times 2 \) matrix was provided showing the computation of eigenvalues, eigenvectors, and construction of \( S \) and \( \Lambda \).
- **Non-uniqueness of eigenvector matrix \( S \)** due to scaling freedom of eigenvectors.
- **Powers of matrices** can be diagonalized similarly using the same eigenvector matrix \( S \).
- **Not all matrices are diagonalizable**, and the concept of diagonalizability hinges on the number of independent eigenvectors.
- The lecture sets the stage for the spectral theorem, which will be proved in subsequent lectures, stating that every real symmetric matrix is diagonalizable.

### FAQ

**Q1: Why do we need \( n \) independent eigenvectors to diagonalize an \( n \times n \) matrix?**  
A1: Because the matrix \( S \) formed by eigenvectors must be invertible, and invertibility requires the columns to be linearly independent. Without \( n \) independent eigenvectors, \( S \) cannot be invertible, and thus \( A \) cannot be diagonalized.

**Q2: Can a matrix with repeated eigenvalues be diagonalizable?**  
A2: It depends. If the geometric multiplicity (number of independent eigenvectors) equals the algebraic multiplicity (multiplicity of the eigenvalue), then yes. Otherwise, no.

A3: Diagonalization simplifies matrix operations, especially powers and exponentials of matrices, which are common in differential equations, quantum mechanics, and machine learning algorithms.

**Q4: What does the spectral theorem state?**  
A4: The spectral theorem states that any real symmetric matrix is diagonalizable by an orthogonal matrix, and all its eigenvalues are real.

### Notes

- ([00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISB87lDKOVE&t=0s)) ### Summary

This lecture, part of a Week 4 series in machine learning foundations, delves into the practical utility of diagonalization in linear algebra through a detailed exploration of the Fibonacci sequence. The primary objective is to demonstrate how diagonalization can be used to efficiently compute higher-order terms of a linear recurrence relation like the Fibonacci sequence without resorting to brute force iterative calculations. The lecture emphasizes the power of linear algebraic methods in solving such problems and sets the stage for deeper discussions on spectral theory in future lectures.

The Fibonacci sequence, a well-known series starting from 0 and 1 where each subsequent term is the sum of the two preceding ones, is explored here not merely as a mathematical curiosity but as an example of a linear recurrence relation. The sequence is defined by the recurrence \( F_{k+2} = F_{k+1} + F_k \). While the typical approach to finding terms such as \( F_{100} \) involves iterative addition or programming loops, the lecture introduces an elegant linear algebra technique using matrix diagonalization.

The key insight is to represent the Fibonacci recurrence as a matrix multiplication problem. By defining a state vector \( u_k = [F_{k+1}, F_k]^T \), the recurrence can be rewritten as \( u_{k+1} = A u_k \) where \( A \) is a \( 2 \times 2 \) matrix:

\[
A = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 1 \\
1 & 0
\end{bmatrix}
\]

Starting from the initial vector \( u_0 = [1, 0]^T \), the problem reduces to computing \( u_k = A^k u_0 \). Directly computing \( A^k \) can be computationally expensive for large \( k \), but if \( A \) is diagonalizable, then \( A^k \) can be expressed in terms of its eigenvalues and eigenvectors, which simplify the power computations significantly.

The lecture proceeds to demonstrate the diagonalization of \( A \). The characteristic polynomial is found by solving:

\[
\det(A - \lambda I) = \lambda^2 - \lambda - 1 = 0
\]

The roots of this quadratic equation are:

\[
\lambda_1 = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \quad \text{and} \quad \lambda_2 = \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2}
\]

These eigenvalues correspond to the famous golden ratio and its conjugate. Next, the eigenvectors corresponding to each eigenvalue are calculated. For each eigenvalue \( \lambda_i \), the eigenvector \( x_i \) satisfies \( (A - \lambda_i I) x_i = 0 \). The eigenvectors are found to be proportional to \( [\lambda_i, 1]^T \).

The initial vector \( u_0 \) can be expressed as a linear combination of the eigenvectors:

\[
u_0 = C_1 x_1 + C_2 x_2
\]

By solving the system, the constants \( C_1 \) and \( C_2 \) are found to be \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \) and \( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \), respectively. This decomposition allows the computation of \( u_k \) as:

\[
u_k = C_1 \lambda_1^k x_1 + C_2 \lambda_2^k x_2
\]

From this, the Fibonacci term \( F_k \) can be extracted. This expression leads to the well-known closed-form formula for the Fibonacci sequence, often termed Binet’s formula:

\[
F_k = \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \left( \lambda_1^k - \lambda_2^k \right)
\]

Since \( |\lambda_2| < 1 \), the term \( \lambda_2^k \) becomes negligible for large \( k \), providing a very good approximation to \( F_k \) by simply calculating \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \lambda_1^k \). This approximation is computationally efficient and can be used to estimate very large Fibonacci numbers, such as the 100th term, without iterating through all previous terms.

The lecture highlights that this approach is valid because the Fibonacci recurrence is linear. The linearity ensures that the transition from \( u_k \) to \( u_{k+1} \) is a linear transformation represented by matrix \( A \). If the recurrence was nonlinear, these linear algebra tools would not apply.

In summary, the lecture showcases how diagonalization provides a powerful tool for analyzing and solving linear recurrence relations by simplifying matrix powers. The Fibonacci sequence serves as a canonical example that illustrates the method clearly and effectively.

Finally, the lecture concludes with a brief preview of upcoming topics, particularly the spectral theorem, which states that any real symmetric matrix is diagonalizable with real eigenvalues. This theorem forms a foundational concept in linear algebra and machine learning, and its exploration will deepen the understanding of diagonalization and eigenvalue problems beyond the Fibonacci example.

**Q2: What is diagonalization and why is it useful?**  
A2: Diagonalization is the process of expressing a matrix in terms of its eigenvalues and eigenvectors, transforming it into a diagonal matrix. This makes raising the matrix to large powers computationally easier, facilitating efficient calculations of sequences defined by linear recurrences.

**Q3: What are the eigenvalues of the Fibonacci matrix, and what do they represent?**
