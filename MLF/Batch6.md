This lecture, part of the Machine Learning Foundations course in the module on Linear Algebra, focuses on Hermitian matrices, a fundamental class of matrices with significant applications in machine learning and related fields. The lecture begins with a refresher on the definition of Hermitian matrices and proceeds to explore two critical properties of Hermitian matrices related to their eigenvalues and eigenvectors. These properties are essential for understanding the diagonalizability of Hermitian matrices, a concept that underpins many algorithms and theoretical results in machine learning.

The lecture opens by defining a Hermitian matrix \( A \) as one that equals its own conjugate transpose, i.e., \( A = A^* \). This property means that when you take the conjugate transpose of the matrix \( A \), the result is the matrix \( A \) itself. The conjugate transpose involves taking the transpose of the matrix and then taking the complex conjugate of each element. A concrete example is provided to illustrate this definition, featuring a \( 2 \times 2 \) matrix with complex entries. Through this example, the instructor shows that the conjugate transpose operation is commutative in this context, meaning you can take the transpose first and then the conjugate or vice versa, and you will arrive at the same result.

One important immediate observation about Hermitian matrices is that their diagonal entries must be real numbers. This is because the diagonal elements must equal their own complex conjugates, which is only true if they are real. This fact plays a crucial role in the spectral properties of Hermitian matrices.

The lecture then states two fundamental properties of Hermitian matrices as theorems:

1. **All eigenvalues of a Hermitian matrix are real.**
2. **Eigenvectors corresponding to distinct eigenvalues of a Hermitian matrix are orthogonal.**

Before proving these properties, the instructor revisits the example matrix to find its eigenvalues explicitly. The characteristic polynomial is calculated, and it is shown that the eigenvalues are \( \lambda_1 = 8 \) and \( \lambda_2 = -1 \), both real numbers, demonstrating the first property in a concrete case.

#### Proof of Property 1: Real Eigenvalues

The proof starts from the eigenvalue equation \( A x = \lambda x \), where \( x \) is a non-zero eigenvector and \( \lambda \) is the eigenvalue. The goal is to show that \( \lambda \) equals its own complex conjugate, i.e., \( \lambda = \overline{\lambda} \), which implies \( \lambda \) is real.

By taking the conjugate transpose of the eigenvalue equation and using the fact that \( A \) is Hermitian (\( A = A^* \)), it is shown that

\[
x^*A x = \overline{\lambda} x^* x,
\]

where \( x^* \) is the conjugate transpose of \( x \). On the other hand, from the original eigenvalue equation,

\[
x^*A x = \lambda x^* x.
\]

Since \( x^* x \neq 0 \) (because \( x \neq 0 \)), equating these two expressions yields \( \lambda = \overline{\lambda} \), proving that \( \lambda \) is real.

#### Proof of Property 2: Orthogonality of Eigenvectors

The second property states that eigenvectors corresponding to distinct eigenvalues are orthogonal. Let \( x \) and \( y \) be eigenvectors corresponding to eigenvalues \( \lambda_1 \) and \( \lambda_2 \) respectively, with \( \lambda_1 \neq \lambda_2 \).

Starting from the inner product \( x^* A y \), the lecture shows two ways to express this:

- Using the fact that \( A y = \lambda_2 y \), it follows that

\[
x^*A y = \lambda_2 x^* y.
\]

- Using the Hermitian property \( A = A^* \), this can also be written as

\[
x^*A y = (A x)^* y = (\lambda_1 x)^*y = \overline{\lambda_1} x^* y = \lambda_1 x^* y,
\]

since from the first property \( \lambda_1 \) is real.

Equating these two expressions yields

\[
\lambda_1 x^*y = \lambda_2 x^* y,
\]

and since \( \lambda_1 \neq \lambda_2 \), it must be that

\[
x^* y = 0,
\]

showing that the eigenvectors are orthogonal.

#### Example Revisited

The instructor revisits the initial example matrix to compute the eigenvectors corresponding to the eigenvalues \( 8 \) and \( -1 \). The eigenvectors are found to be \( x = [1, 1 + i]^T \) and \( y = [1 - i, -1]^T \), respectively. By computing the complex inner product \( x^* y \), it is shown to be zero, confirming the orthogonality property in this specific case.

#### Implications for Diagonalization

The lecture then connects these properties to the important concept of matrix diagonalization. It is noted that if a Hermitian matrix has \( n \) distinct eigenvalues, it necessarily has \( n \) orthogonal eigenvectors, which form a basis for \( \mathbb{C}^n \). Because orthogonal vectors are linearly independent, this implies that such a matrix is diagonalizable.

Diagonalization involves expressing matrix \( A \) as

\[
A = U \Lambda U^{-1},
\]

where \( U \) is a matrix whose columns are the eigenvectors of \( A \), and \( \Lambda \) is a diagonal matrix containing the eigenvalues on the diagonal. Because the eigenvectors are orthogonal (and can be normalized to be orthonormal), \( U \) is a unitary matrix, and \( U^{-1} = U^* \).

This diagonalization is crucial in many machine learning algorithms, including Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and spectral clustering, where working with diagonal matrices simplifies computations.

#### Remarks

- The instructor makes the remark that Hermitian matrices generalize real symmetric matrices. In the real-valued case, conjugation is trivial, and Hermitian matrices reduce to symmetric matrices.
- The lecture also highlights that even in cases where eigenvalues are repeated (degenerate eigenvalues), Hermitian matrices remain diagonalizable, a topic that will be explored in future lectures.

#### Summary and Conclusion

To summarize, the lecture covers:

- The definition of Hermitian matrices and their key structural property: \( A = A^* \).
- The fact that diagonal entries of Hermitian matrices are necessarily real.
- The first fundamental property: all eigenvalues of a Hermitian matrix are real.
- The second fundamental property: eigenvectors corresponding to distinct eigenvalues are orthogonal.
- The consequence that Hermitian matrices with distinct eigenvalues are diagonalizable via a unitary matrix.
- The connection of these properties to the broader topic of diagonalization and its relevance in linear algebra and machine learning.

The lecture concludes by setting the stage for further discussion on the diagonalization of Hermitian matrices when eigenvalues are repeated. The proofs and examples provided offer a solid foundation for understanding the spectral theory of Hermitian matrices, which is essential for advanced linear algebra applications in machine learning.

This lecture, the third in the "Machine Learning Foundations" series during week 5, introduces the concept of **unitary matrices**, which play a crucial role in the diagonalization of Hermitian matrices. The lecture begins by drawing a parallel between unitary matrices in complex vector spaces and orthogonal matrices in real vector spaces, positioning unitary matrices as the complex counterpart of orthogonal matrices.

A **unitary matrix** is defined as a square matrix whose columns form an orthonormal set under the complex inner product, meaning the conjugate transpose of the matrix multiplied by the matrix itself yields the identity matrix. This contrasts with orthogonal matrices, which satisfy the same condition but use the simple transpose in the real-valued case. The notation \( U^*\) (conjugate transpose) replaces \( Q^T \) (transpose) in the complex setting to define unitarity: \(U^* U = I\).

Several examples of unitary matrices are discussed to help solidify the concept, with an emphasis on differentiating unitary matrices from Hermitian matrices, as the two have distinct definitions and properties. The lecture encourages students to verify these examples as homework, reinforcing the understanding of unitarity.

The lecture then proceeds to discuss **key properties of unitary matrices**:

1. **Length Preservation:** Applying a unitary matrix to any vector does not change the vector’s length or norm. Formally, for any vector \( x \), the length of \( Ux \) is the same as the length of \( x \). This is shown through an inner product argument using the definition of unitarity, establishing that \( \|Ux\| = \|x\| \).

2. **Eigenvalues on the Unit Circle:** The eigenvalues \( \lambda \) of a unitary matrix satisfy \( |\lambda| = 1 \), meaning they lie on the complex unit circle. This is significant because, unlike Hermitian matrices whose eigenvalues are always real, the eigenvalues of unitary matrices can be complex but are constrained in magnitude. The proof relies on the fact that the norm of an eigenvector cannot change under the action of a unitary matrix and uses the eigenvalue equation \( Ux = \lambda x \).

3. **Orthogonality of Eigenvectors Corresponding to Distinct Eigenvalues:** Similar to Hermitian matrices, eigenvectors of a unitary matrix corresponding to distinct eigenvalues are orthogonal. The proof uses the unitarity property and the eigenvalue equations for two eigenvectors with different eigenvalues to demonstrate that their inner product must be zero, thereby confirming orthogonality.

Towards the end of the lecture, the instructor previews the **spectral theorem** for Hermitian matrices, which states that any Hermitian matrix \( A \) can be diagonalized by a unitary matrix \( U \) such that \( A = U \Lambda U^* \), where \( \Lambda \) is a diagonal matrix containing the eigenvalues of \( A \). This theorem generalizes the spectral theorem known from real symmetric matrices, which can be diagonalized using orthogonal matrices \( Q \) as \( A = Q \Lambda Q^T \).

The lecture concludes with a summary emphasizing the importance of unitary matrices for diagonalization, their length-preserving nature, the property that their eigenvalues lie on the unit circle, and the orthogonality of eigenvectors corresponding to distinct eigenvalues. The next lectures will build on this foundation by exploring the diagonalization of Hermitian matrices using unitary matrices.

### Key Insights

- **Unitary matrices generalize orthogonal matrices to complex vector spaces**, using conjugate transpose instead of transpose.
- The defining condition for a unitary matrix \( U \) is \( U^*U = I \), where \( U^* \) denotes the conjugate transpose.
- **Unitary matrices preserve vector lengths**: \( \|Ux\| = \|x\| \) for all vectors \( x \).
- The **eigenvalues of a unitary matrix lie on the unit circle** in the complex plane, i.e., \( |\lambda| = 1 \).
- Eigenvectors corresponding to **distinct eigenvalues of a unitary matrix are orthogonal**.
- **Hermitian matrices can be diagonalized by unitary matrices**, a key result known as the spectral theorem.
- In the real case, **real symmetric matrices are diagonalizable by orthogonal matrices**, a special case of the spectral theorem.

---

### Core Concepts

- **Unitary Matrix:** A complex square matrix \( U \) satisfying \( U^* U = I \), where the columns are orthonormal with respect to the complex inner product.
- **Orthogonal Matrix:** A real square matrix \( Q \) such that \( Q^T Q = I \), with orthonormal columns.
- **Hermitian Matrix:** A complex matrix \( A \) that is equal to its own conjugate transpose, \( A = A^* \).
- **Diagonalization:** Representing a matrix \( A \) as \( A = U \Lambda U^* \), where \( \Lambda \) is diagonal and \( U \) is unitary.
- **Spectral Theorem:** The theorem stating that Hermitian matrices can be diagonalized by unitary matrices, and real symmetric matrices by orthogonal matrices.

---

### Detailed Explanation of Properties

1. **Length Preservation by Unitary Matrices:**  
   Consider any vectors \( x \) and \( y \) in a complex vector space. Because \( U \) is unitary, \( U^*U = I \). Hence:  
   \[
   (Ux) \cdot (Uy) = (Ux)^* (Uy) = x^*U^* U y = x^* y = x \cdot y
   \]  
   This proves that the inner product between two vectors remains unchanged after applying \( U \), which implies the length (norm) is preserved since the length is the inner product of a vector with itself.

2. **Eigenvalues on the Unit Circle:**  
   Let \( Ux = \lambda x \) for some eigenvector \( x \neq 0 \) with eigenvalue \( \lambda \). Since \( U \) preserves length:  
   \[
   \|Ux\| = \|x\| \Rightarrow \|\lambda x\| = \|x\| \Rightarrow |\lambda| \|x\| = \|x\| \implies |\lambda| = 1
   \]  
   This shows that the eigenvalues of a unitary matrix must lie on the unit circle in the complex plane.

3. **Orthogonality of Eigenvectors with Distinct Eigenvalues:**  
   Suppose \( Ux = \lambda_1 x \) and \( Uy = \lambda_2 y \) with \( \lambda_1 \neq \lambda_2 \). Using unitarity and inner products:  
   \[
   x \cdot y = (Ux) \cdot (Uy) = (\lambda_1 x) \cdot (\lambda_2 y) = \overline{\lambda_1} \lambda_2 (x \cdot y)
   \]  
   Rearranging gives:  
   \[
   (1 - \overline{\lambda_1} \lambda_2)(x \cdot y) = 0
   \]  
   Since \( \overline{\lambda_1} \lambda_2 \neq 1 \) (due to distinct eigenvalues), it follows that \( x \cdot y = 0 \), proving orthogonality.

### FAQ

**Q1: What is the difference between a unitary matrix and an orthogonal matrix?**  
A1: An orthogonal matrix is a real square matrix whose transpose is its inverse (\(Q^T Q = I\)), meaning its columns are orthonormal in the real inner product. A unitary matrix is the complex counterpart, where the matrix satisfies \(U^*U = I\), with \(U^*\) being the conjugate transpose. Unitary matrices preserve the complex inner product.

**Q2: Why do eigenvalues of a unitary matrix lie on the unit circle?**  
A2: Because a unitary matrix preserves vector lengths, the norm of the eigenvector does not change under multiplication by the matrix. This condition forces the eigenvalue’s magnitude to be 1, ensuring eigenvalues lie on the unit circle in the complex plane.

**Q3: Are the eigenvalues of a unitary matrix always real?**  
A3: No, eigenvalues of unitary matrices are generally complex numbers with magnitude 1, but they are not necessarily real. This contrasts with Hermitian matrices, whose eigenvalues are always real.

**Q4: Can the spectral theorem be applied to any matrix?**  
A4: No, the spectral theorem applies specifically to Hermitian matrices (or real symmetric matrices in the real case). It guarantees they can be diagonalized by unitary (or orthogonal) matrices. Non-Hermitian matrices may not be diagonalizable or may require different decompositions.

**Q5: How do unitary matrices relate to diagonalization of Hermitian matrices?**  
A5: Hermitian matrices can be diagonalized as \( A = U \Lambda U^* \), where \( U \) is unitary and \( \Lambda \) is diagonal containing the eigenvalues. Unitary matrices provide the change of basis consisting of eigenvectors, preserving inner products and enabling this diagonalization.

### Core Concepts and Definitions

1. **Hermitian Matrix**: A complex square matrix \( A \) is Hermitian if it equals its own conjugate transpose, i.e., \( A^* = A \). This property ensures the matrix is self-adjoint.

2. **Unitary Matrix**: A square matrix \( U \) is unitary if \( U^*U = I \), where \( U^* \) is the conjugate transpose of \( U \) and \( I \) is the identity matrix. Unitary matrices preserve inner products and orthonormality.

3. **Unitary Diagonalizability**: A matrix \( A \) is unitarily diagonalizable if there exists a unitary matrix \( U \) such that
   \[
   A = U \Lambda U^*
   \]
   where \( \Lambda \) is a diagonal matrix containing eigenvalues of \( A \).

4. **Schur’s Theorem**: States that any \( n \times n \) complex matrix \( A \) can be transformed into an upper triangular matrix \( T \) by a unitary similarity transformation:
   \[
   A = U T U^*
   \]
   where \( U \) is unitary and \( T \) is upper triangular. Schur’s theorem serves as a stepping stone toward proving the diagonalizability of Hermitian matrices.

   - Motivation for studying diagonalizability.
   - Definitions of conjugate transpose, Hermitian matrix, and unitary matrices.
   - Objective: prove Hermitian matrices are unitarily diagonalizable.

2. **Strategy to Prove Diagonalizability**

   - Then, use this result to show that a Hermitian matrix, due to the property \( A^* = A \), is unitarily diagonalizable.

### Key Insights

- **Schur’s Theorem is Fundamental**: It guarantees that any complex square matrix can be brought to an upper triangular form by a unitary transformation. This is a powerful tool because it preserves eigenvalues and simplifies matrix structure without losing orthogonality.

- **Hermitian Matrices are Special Cases**: Since Hermitian matrices satisfy \( A = A^* \), their upper triangular form must also be Hermitian, which forces the upper triangular matrix to be diagonal. This property ensures Hermitian matrices are unitarily diagonalizable—something that will be rigorously proven in the next lecture.

- **Procedure is Constructive**: The lecture’s proof not only establishes theoretical existence but provides a clear algorithmic procedure to find the unitary matrix and the upper triangular matrix, involving eigenvalue decomposition, basis extension, and Gram-Schmidt orthonormalization.

- **Eigenvectors and Orthonormal Bases**: Selecting an eigenvector and extending it to an orthonormal basis via Gram-Schmidt is crucial. This process ensures the constructed matrices are unitary, maintaining orthogonality and norm preservation.

- **Repeated Eigenvalues and Non-Diagonalizability**: The example matrix shows that when eigenvalues have multiplicity and there are insufficient eigenvectors, the matrix may not be diagonalizable but is still upper triangularizable. This illustrates the broader applicability of Schur’s theorem beyond diagonalization.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q1: What does it mean for a matrix to be unitarily diagonalizable?**  
A: A matrix \( A \) is unitarily diagonalizable if there exists a unitary matrix \( U \) such that \( A = U \Lambda U^* \), where \( \Lambda \) is diagonal. This means \( A \) can be represented in an orthonormal eigenbasis.

**Q3: Can every matrix be diagonalized?**  
A: No. While every matrix can be upper triangularized (Schur’s theorem), not every matrix can be diagonalized. Diagonalizability depends on the existence of a full set of linearly independent eigenvectors.

**Q4: How does Hermitian property influence diagonalizability?**  
A: Hermitian matrices, by definition, equal their own conjugate transpose. This symmetry ensures that their Schur form (upper triangular matrix) must be diagonal, guaranteeing unitary diagonalizability.

**Q5: What role does Gram-Schmidt play in the proof?**  
A: Gram-Schmidt orthonormalization is used to extend eigenvectors to an orthonormal basis, ensuring the constructed transformation matrix is unitary.

Through a detailed proof for the \( 3 \times 3 \) case and an illustrative example, the lecture demonstrated the procedure for such transformations, setting the stage for the next lecture. The next step will leverage Schur’s theorem to establish the unitary diagonalizability of Hermitian matrices, a cornerstone result in linear algebra with wide-ranging applications in machine learning, physics, and engineering.

This lecture, part of a machine learning foundations course focused on linear algebra, presents and proves the **spectral theorem**—a fundamental result concerning Hermitian matrices and their diagonalizability. The spectral theorem states that any Hermitian matrix can be diagonalized by a unitary matrix, meaning there exists a unitary matrix \( U \) such that \( U^* A U \) is a diagonal matrix with real entries. The lecture also highlights an important corollary for real symmetric matrices, which asserts that any real symmetric matrix can be orthogonally diagonalized.

The proof leverages Schur's theorem from the previous lecture, which establishes that every matrix can be transformed into an upper triangular matrix by a unitary similarity transform. By applying this theorem to Hermitian matrices and examining the properties of the resulting triangular matrix, the lecturer shows that the matrix must actually be diagonal with real diagonal entries, thereby proving the spectral theorem.

To solidify understanding, the lecture provides explicit examples of diagonalizing Hermitian matrices using unitary transformations and discusses the real symmetric case where the unitary matrix is replaced by an orthogonal matrix. It concludes by clarifying that while Hermitian matrices are always unitarily diagonalizable, the converse is not true—there exist non-Hermitian matrices that are still unitarily diagonalizable.

1. **Hermitian Matrix:** A complex square matrix \( A \) that satisfies \( A = A^*\), where \( A^* \) is the conjugate transpose of \( A \).
2. **Unitary Matrix:** A complex square matrix \( U \) such that \( U^* U = I \), where \( I \) is the identity matrix.
3. **Diagonalization:** The process of finding a matrix \( U \) such that \( U^{-1} A U \) (or \( U^* A U \) for unitary matrices) is a diagonal matrix.
4. **Spectral Theorem:** States that every Hermitian matrix is unitarily diagonalizable with real eigenvalues.

### Detailed Explanation and Proof Outline

**Statement of the Spectral Theorem:**  
For any Hermitian matrix \( A \), there exists a unitary matrix \( U \) such that  
\[
U^* A U = D,
\]  
where \( D \) is a diagonal matrix with **real** entries.

**Key Steps of the Proof:**

- By Schur’s theorem, for any square matrix \( A \), there exists a unitary matrix \( U \) such that  
\[
U^* A U = T,
\]  
where \( T \) is an upper triangular matrix.
  
- Since \( A \) is Hermitian, \( A = A^*\). Taking the conjugate transpose of the similarity transformation:  
\[
T^* = (U^*A U)^* = U^*A^* U = U^* A U = T.
\]

- Therefore, \( T = T^*\). But \( T \) is also upper triangular, and \( T^* \) is lower triangular. The only matrix that is both upper and lower triangular is diagonal.

- Hence, \( T \) must be diagonal.

- Next, the diagonal entries \( T_{ii} \) satisfy \( T_{ii} = \overline{T_{ii}} \), implying these diagonal elements are **real**.

- Thus, \( A \) is unitarily diagonalizable with real eigenvalues.

### Examples and Applications

**Example 1: Diagonalizing a Hermitian Matrix**

Consider a complex Hermitian matrix \( A \) such that \( A = A^*\). The characteristic polynomial can be computed to find eigenvalues, which are guaranteed to be real. Eigenvectors corresponding to these eigenvalues can be computed and normalized to form an orthonormal basis. Collecting these normalized eigenvectors into a matrix \( U \), one can verify that \( U^* A U \) yields a diagonal matrix with the eigenvalues on its diagonal.

- The lecture explicitly constructs eigenvectors \( Z_1 \) and \( Z_2 \) for a sample matrix, checks their orthogonality, and normalizes them to form the unitary matrix \( U \).

- The operation \( U^* A U \) results in a diagonal matrix with the eigenvalues, confirming the spectral theorem.

**Example 2: Real Symmetric Matrices**

- For real symmetric matrices (the real analog of Hermitian), the spectral theorem states there is an orthogonal matrix \( Q \) such that:  
\[
Q^T A Q = D,
\]  
where \( D \) is diagonal with real entries.

- The proof follows from the Hermitian case by noting that for real symmetric matrices, the eigenvalues are real and eigenvectors can be chosen as real vectors, making \( U \) a real orthogonal matrix \( Q \).

---

### Important Corollaries and Remarks

- **Real symmetric matrices are orthogonally diagonalizable:** This is a special case of the spectral theorem when restricted to real vector spaces.

- **Eigenvalues of Hermitian matrices are real:** This property is both a consequence and an integral part of the spectral theorem.

- **Unitary diagonalizability does not imply Hermitian:** The converse of the spectral theorem is false. There exist matrices which are not Hermitian but can still be diagonalized by a unitary matrix.

---

### Counterexample: Unitary Diagonalizable but Non-Hermitian Matrix

The lecture provides a concrete example of a matrix \( A = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \), which is not Hermitian since \( A^* \neq A \). However, this matrix has distinct eigenvalues \( i \) and \( -i \), indicating it is diagonalizable with complex eigenvalues.

- The corresponding eigenvectors can be normalized to form a unitary matrix \( U \).

- Verifying \( U^* A U \) yields a diagonal matrix shows that the matrix is unitarily diagonalizable despite not being Hermitian.

This example emphasizes the critical distinction that **Hermitian matrices are a subset of unitarily diagonalizable matrices**, but not all unitarily diagonalizable matrices are Hermitian.

---

### Summary of Key Points

- The spectral theorem guarantees the unitary diagonalization of Hermitian matrices with real eigenvalues.

- The real analogue states real symmetric matrices are orthogonally diagonalizable.

- The proof hinges on Schur’s theorem and the property that a Hermitian matrix’s Schur form must be diagonal.

- Eigenvectors of Hermitian matrices can be chosen orthonormally, forming a unitary matrix that diagonalizes the matrix.

- Unitary diagonalizability is a broader property than Hermitian symmetry, as demonstrated by counterexamples.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q1: What is the spectral theorem?**  
**A1:** The spectral theorem states that every Hermitian matrix can be diagonalized by a unitary matrix, resulting in a diagonal matrix with real eigenvalues.

**Q2: Does every diagonalizable matrix have to be Hermitian?**  
**A2:** No. While every Hermitian matrix is unitarily diagonalizable, there exist non-Hermitian matrices that can also be diagonalized by unitary matrices.

**Q3: What is the difference between unitary and orthogonal diagonalization?**  
**A3:** Unitary diagonalization applies to complex vector spaces and uses unitary matrices, while orthogonal diagonalization applies to real vector spaces and uses orthogonal matrices.

**Q4: Why are the eigenvalues of Hermitian matrices always real?**  
**A4:** Because a Hermitian matrix equals its own conjugate transpose, the diagonal elements of its diagonalized form must be equal to their own complex conjugate, which means they are real numbers.

**Q5: How does Schur's theorem help in proving the spectral theorem?**  
**A5:** Schur’s theorem guarantees an upper triangular factorization by a unitary matrix for any matrix. For Hermitian matrices, this triangular matrix must be equal to its conjugate transpose, forcing it to be diagonal, thus proving the spectral theorem.

### Notes

- ([00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTErMgNIKHQ&t=0s)) ### Summary

This lecture, part of a series on machine learning foundations, focuses on the concept of **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)** as a natural extension of the spectral theorem previously discussed. The key objective is to understand how any rectangular real matrix, regardless of whether it is square or symmetric, can be decomposed into the product of two orthogonal matrices and a diagonal matrix. This decomposition, known as the SVD, is fundamental in numerous areas of machine learning, statistics, and data analysis.

The lecture begins with a brief recap of the **spectral theorem** for real symmetric matrices, which guarantees orthogonal diagonalizability of such matrices. It revisits the properties of eigenvalues and eigenvectors, emphasizing that all eigenvalues of a real symmetric matrix are real, and the matrix can be expressed as \( A = Q \Lambda Q^T \), where \( Q \) is an orthogonal matrix formed by eigenvectors, and \( \Lambda \) is a diagonal matrix of eigenvalues.

An illustrative example with a 2x2 matrix is provided, showing how eigenvalues and eigenvectors are calculated and normalized. This also serves as a sanity check to verify orthogonality properties such as \( Q^T Q = I \) and reconstruction \( Q \Lambda Q^T = A \).

The lecture then transitions to the more general and powerful framework of **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)**, which applies to any real matrix \( A \) of dimensions \( m \times n \), including non-square and non-symmetric matrices. It clarifies that while not all matrices can be diagonalized in the classical sense, every real matrix can be decomposed as:

\[
A = Q_1 \Sigma Q_2^T
\]

where:

- \( Q_1 \) is an \( m \times m \) orthogonal matrix,
- \( Q_2 \) is an \( n \times n \) orthogonal matrix,
- \( \Sigma \) is an \( m \times n \) diagonal matrix (with non-negative real numbers called singular values on the diagonal).

The lecture carefully outlines the dimensions and properties of these matrices. Both \( Q_1 \) and \( Q_2 \) satisfy orthogonality conditions: \( Q_1^T Q_1 = I_m \) and \( Q_2^T Q_2 = I_n \).

To explain **why SVD holds for any matrix**, the lecturer constructs a proof leveraging the spectral theorem indirectly by analyzing the matrix \( A^T A \):

1. \( A^T A \) is an \( n \times n \) real symmetric matrix, which guarantees the existence of an orthonormal eigenbasis and real eigenvalues due to the spectral theorem.
2. The eigenvalues \( \lambda_i \) of \( A^T A \) are shown to be non-negative since each \( \lambda_i = \| A x_i \|^2 \geq 0 \).
3. The singular values \( \sigma_i \) of \( A \) are defined as the square roots of the positive eigenvalues of \( A^T A \), i.e., \( \sigma_i = \sqrt{\lambda_i} \).

The lecture then defines vectors \( y_i = \frac{1}{\sigma_i} A x_i \) for \( i = 1, \dots, r \) (where \( r \) is the number of positive eigenvalues), showing these vectors form an orthonormal set in \( \mathbb{R}^m \). This set can be extended to form an orthonormal basis of \( \mathbb{R}^m \). The matrices \( Q_1 \) and \( Q_2 \) are then built from these orthonormal bases of \( \mathbb{R}^m \) and \( \mathbb{R}^n \), respectively.

The proof culminates by demonstrating that the product \( Q_1^T A Q_2 \) yields the diagonal matrix \( \Sigma \) with singular values on the diagonal, validating the SVD representation of \( A \).

Finally, the lecturer remarks on the interpretation of the matrices involved:

- \( Q_2 \) contains the eigenvectors of \( A^T A \).
- \( Q_1 \) contains the eigenvectors of \( A A^T \), another symmetric matrix derived from \( A \).

This connection further aligns the SVD with eigen decomposition through the spectral theorem, albeit applied to related symmetric matrices.

The lecture concludes with a summary and an outlook toward the next session, which will focus on computing the SVD of a concrete example matrix, thereby solidifying the theoretical concepts with practical computation.
