This lecture on Machine Learning Foundations provides a detailed exploration of multivariate calculus concepts, focusing primarily on the geometry of high-dimensional spaces and the foundational calculus tools required for understanding functions from \(\mathbb{R}^d \to \mathbb{R}\). The lecture begins by generalizing univariate functions to multivariate functions and introduces the geometric intuition essential for working with these functions. The core concepts covered include the definitions and properties of lines and hyperplanes in \( \mathbb{R}^d \), the distinction between points and vectors, and the crucial calculus tools of partial derivatives and gradients.

---

### Introduction to Multivariate Functions and Geometry

The lecture starts by recalling univariate calculus, where functions map real numbers to real numbers (\(f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}\)). It then extends this to multivariate functions where the domain is \(d\)-dimensional (\(f: \mathbb{R}^d \to \mathbb{R}\)). While the output remains a single real number, the input is now a vector in a high-dimensional space. Understanding functions in these high-dimensional domains requires a solid grasp of geometric ideas such as lines and planes, which serve as the building blocks for more complex structures.

The lecture emphasizes that these geometric concepts are not just abstract but provide an intuitive understanding essential for multivariate calculus, especially in machine learning contexts where functions often depend on many variables.

---

### Lines in \( \mathbb{R}^d \)

A line in \( \mathbb{R}^d \) is defined as a subset of \( \mathbb{R}^d \) parameterized by two vectors: a point \( \mathbf{u} \in \mathbb{R}^d \) and a direction vector \( \mathbf{v} \in \mathbb{R}^d \). Formally, the line passing through the point \( \mathbf{u} \) along direction \( \mathbf{v} \) is the set of all vectors \( \mathbf{x} \) such that:

\[
\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{u} + \alpha \mathbf{v} \quad \text{for} \quad \alpha \in \mathbb{R}
\]

Alternatively, a line can also be described as passing through two points \( \mathbf{u} \) and \( \mathbf{u}' \):

\[
\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{u} + \alpha (\mathbf{u}' - \mathbf{u}) \quad \text{or} \quad \mathbf{x} = (1 - \alpha) \mathbf{u} + \alpha \mathbf{u}' \quad \text{for} \quad \alpha \in \mathbb{R}
\]

The lecture clarifies that these two definitions are equivalent because the direction vector \( \mathbf{v} \) can be taken as the difference between \( \mathbf{u}' \) and \( \mathbf{u} \). This equivalence is straightforward to prove and is a fundamental fact in geometry.

An illustrative example is given in \( \mathbb{R}^2 \): a line passing through the point \((1,1)\) in the direction \((1,2)\) is the set of points \(\mathbf{x} = (1,1) + \alpha (1,2)\), which visually corresponds to a straight line in the plane.

---

### Hyperplanes in \( \mathbb{R}^d \)

A hyperplane is a generalization of a plane to \(d\)-dimensional space and typically has dimension \(d-1\). It is defined as the set of points \( \mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^d \) that satisfy:

\[
\mathbf{w}^\top \mathbf{x} = b
\]

where \( \mathbf{w} \in \mathbb{R}^d \) is a normal vector to the hyperplane and \(b \in \mathbb{R}\) is a scalar. The vector \( \mathbf{w} \) is perpendicular (normal) to the hyperplane, meaning any vector lying on the hyperplane is orthogonal to \( \mathbf{w} \).

For example, in \( \mathbb{R}^3 \), the hyperplane defined by:

\[
x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = 1
\]

is a plane normal to the vector \( \mathbf{w} = (1,1,1) \). Visualizing this, one can imagine a flat sheet passing through the three-dimensional space, intersecting the axes at points like \((1, 0, 0)\), \((0, 1, 0)\), and \((0, 0, 1)\), forming a planar surface.

This section also discusses the distinction between points and vectors. Both are represented as tuples in \( \mathbb{R}^d \), but their interpretation is different:

- **Points** represent locations in space.
- **Vectors** represent directions or displacements.

The lecture highlights that while the algebraic representation may be the same, the geometric meaning differs. For example, you can have a line passing through a point \( \mathbf{u} \) in the direction of a vector \( \mathbf{v} \), but it does not make sense to say a point is perpendicular to another pointâ€”only vectors can be perpendicular.

---

### Partial Derivatives and Gradients

The lecture then transitions to the calculus portion, introducing partial derivatives as the fundamental building blocks of multivariate calculus. A partial derivative measures the rate of change of a function with respect to one variable while keeping all other variables fixed.

**Definition of Partial Derivative:**

Given a function \(f: \mathbb{R}^d \to \mathbb{R}\), the partial derivative with respect to the \(i\)-th variable at a point \(\mathbf{v} \in \mathbb{R}^d\) is defined as:

\[
\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i}(\mathbf{v}) = \lim_{\alpha \to 0} \frac{f(\mathbf{v} + \alpha \mathbf{e}_i) - f(\mathbf{v})}{\alpha}
\]

Here, \(\mathbf{e}_i\) is the coordinate vector with 1 in the \(i\)-th position and 0 elsewhere, ensuring that only the \(i\)-th component of \(\mathbf{v}\) changes.

This definition reduces to the standard derivative in one dimension when \(d=1\). For the simple example function:

\[
f(x_1, x_2) = x_1^2 + x_2^2
\]

The partial derivatives are:

\[
\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_1} = 2x_1, \quad \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_2} = 2x_2
\]

Evaluated at a point \(\mathbf{v} = (v_1, v_2)\), these become \(2v_1\) and \(2v_2\), respectively.

---

### Gradient Vector

The gradient of a function \( f \) at a point \( \mathbf{v} \) is a vector that collects all the partial derivatives:

\[
\nabla f(\mathbf{v}) = \begin{bmatrix}
\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_1}(\mathbf{v}) \\
\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_2}(\mathbf{v}) \\
\vdots \\
\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_d}(\mathbf{v})
\end{bmatrix}
\]

The gradient is often expressed as a column vector, while the derivative with respect to a vector variable can be viewed as a row vector; this distinction is mostly a matter of notation. The key point is that the gradient gives the direction of steepest ascent of the function \(f\).

For the earlier example, the gradient vector at \(\mathbf{v}\) is:

\[
\nabla f(\mathbf{v}) = \begin{bmatrix} 2v_1 \\ 2v_2 \end{bmatrix}
\]

Another example discussed is a linear function in three variables:

\[
f(x_1, x_2, x_3) = x_1 + 2x_2 + 3x_3
\]

Here, the gradient is constant and given by:

\[
\nabla f = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{bmatrix}
\]

This shows that for linear functions, the gradient does not depend on the input point and remains fixed.

---

### Core Concepts and Insights

1. **Multivariate functions extend univariate functions** by allowing inputs to be vectors in high-dimensional space, but outputs remain scalar real values.

2. **Lines in \( \mathbb{R}^d \)** can be parameterized by a point and a direction vector or equivalently by two points, with both approaches defining the same set of points.

3. **Hyperplanes are \(d-1\) dimensional subsets** of \( \mathbb{R}^d \) defined by a linear equation involving a normal vector. They generalize the concept of planes to higher dimensions.

4. **Distinguishing vectors and points is essential:** Points represent fixed locations in space, while vectors represent directions or displacements. Both are tuples in \( \mathbb{R}^d \).

5. **Partial derivatives measure changes in function values** when one variable changes, keeping others fixed, and can be generalized to any dimension using coordinate vectors.

6. **The gradient vector aggregates all partial derivatives** and points in the direction of the steepest increase of the function value.

7. **Linear functions have constant gradients** independent of the point of evaluation.

---

### Applications and Relevance

Understanding these foundational concepts is critical in machine learning, where objective functions often depend on many variables. Optimization techniques like gradient descent rely on gradients to iteratively update parameters to minimize or maximize loss functions. The geometric intuition about lines and hyperplanes also aids in understanding linear classifiers, support vector machines, and decision boundaries.

The lecture sets the stage for future topics that will build on these foundations, such as Hessians (second-order derivatives), Jacobians (derivatives of vector-valued functions), and more complex optimization methods essential for training machine learning models.

### Notes

- ([00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLLbl0vucCc&t=0s)) ### Summary

This lecture delves into multiple interpretations and applications of the gradient in functions from \(\mathbb{R}^d \to \mathbb{R}\), moving beyond its basic computational definition as a vector of partial derivatives. The session methodically explores geometric, analytic, and optimization perspectives, providing a comprehensive understanding of the gradientâ€™s role in multivariate calculus and machine learning. The lecture covers linear approximations, tangent planes, contour sets, directional derivatives, the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, directions of steepest ascent and descent, and critical points. It concludes with a brief introduction to higher-order approximations involving the Hessian matrix.

#### Introduction to the Gradient

The gradient is introduced as a vector of partial derivatives, representing how a multivariate function changes with respect to each variable. While previously defined computationally, this lecture focuses on more intuitive and geometric interpretations.

---

### Linear Approximation Interpretation

The lecture begins with the concept of linear approximation for one-dimensional functions, which approximates \(f(x)\) near \(x^*\) as:
\[
f(x) \approx f(x^*) + f'(x^*)(x - x^*)
\]

This is then generalized to functions from \(\mathbb{R}^d \to \mathbb{R}\). For a point \(v \in \mathbb{R}^d\) and a nearby point \(x\), the linear approximation is:
\[
f(x) \approx f(v) + \nabla f(v)^T (x - v)
\]

Breaking down the gradient into components, the approximation expands to:
\[
f(x) \approx f(v) + \sum_{i=1}^d \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i}(v) (x_i - v_i)
\]

This approximation is only valid when \(x\) is close to \(v\).

To clarify, the lecture considers a two-dimensional example \(f: \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}\). Fixing one variable and varying the other, the partial linear approximations are:
\[
f(y_1, v_2) \approx f(v_1, v_2) + \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_1}(v)(y_1 - v_1)
\]
\[
f(v_1, y_2) \approx f(v_1, v_2) + \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_2}(v)(y_2 - v_2)
\]

If both variables change simultaneously, the change in function value is approximately the sum of these individual changes, leading to the full linear approximation formula.

---

### Example: Quadratic Function Approximation

An example function \(f(x_1, x_2) = x_1^2 + x_2^2\) is considered, and its linear approximation around \(v = (6, 2)\) is computed:

- \(f(v) = 6^2 + 2^2 = 40\)
- \(\nabla f(v) = (2 \times 6, 2 \times 2) = (12, 4)\)

The linear approximation is:
\[
f(x) \approx 40 + 12(x_1 - 6) + 4(x_2 - 2) = 12x_1 + 4x_2 - 40
\]

This linear approximation is exact at the point \(v\) and valid near \(v\).

---

### Tangent Plane Interpretation

The graph of \(f\), a surface in \(\mathbb{R}^{d+1}\), can be locally approximated by the graph of its linear approximation \(L_v f\), which is a plane tangent to the surface at \((v, f(v))\).

For \(f: \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}\), the tangent plane at \(v\) touches the graph of \(f\) exactly at the point \((v, f(v))\), providing a geometric visualization of the gradient as the slope of this plane.

---

### Gradient and Contour Sets

The gradient of \(f\) at a point \(v\) is orthogonal (perpendicular) to the contour or level set of \(f\) passing through \(v\). The contour set is defined as:
\[
\{x \in \mathbb{R}^d : f(x) = f(v)\}
\]

This means the gradient points in the direction of greatest increase in \(f\), perpendicular to the curves where \(f\) is constant.

A proof is sketched by considering the linear approximation level set:
\[
\{x : L_v f(x) = f(v)\}
\]
which forms a plane perpendicular to \(\nabla f(v)\).

---

### Directional Derivative

The directional derivative of \(f\) at \(v\) along a direction \(u\) in \(\mathbb{R}^d\) is defined as:
\[
D_u f(v) = \lim_{\alpha \to 0} \frac{f(v + \alpha u) - f(v)}{\alpha}
\]

Using the linear approximation, this limit evaluates to:
\[
D_u f(v) = \nabla f(v)^T u
\]

This formula shows that the directional derivative is the dot product of the gradient and the direction vector \(u\). It measures the instantaneous rate of change of \(f\) as one moves from \(v\) in the direction \(u\).

---

### Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality and Steepest Ascent

The lecture introduces the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to bound the inner product of two vectors \(a, b\):
\[

- \|a\| \|b\| \leq a^T b \leq \|a\| \|b\|
\]

Equality holds if and only if one vector is a scalar multiple of the other.

Using this inequality, the direction \(u\) that maximizes the directional derivative \(D_u f(v)\) subject to \(\|u\| = 1\) is aligned with the gradient:
\[
u = \frac{\nabla f(v)}{\|\nabla f(v)\|}
\]

Thus, the gradient points in the direction of steepest ascent.

---

### Descent Directions

Conversely, the set of directions along which the function decreases (descent directions) at point \(v\) are those \(u\) where:
\[
\nabla f(v)^T u < 0
\]

This concept is crucial for optimization algorithms that seek to minimize functions by moving in descent directions.

---

### Critical Points and Optimality Conditions

A critical point \(v\) of \(f\) is defined by the condition:
\[
\nabla f(v) = 0
\]

At critical points, \(f\) may have local minima, maxima, or saddle points. However, \(\nabla f(v) = 0\) is a necessary but not sufficient condition for optimality.

This idea generalizes the one-dimensional notion where stationary points are candidates for extrema.

---

### Higher-Order Approximations and the Hessian

Beyond linear approximations, the lecture briefly introduces quadratic approximations involving the Hessian matrix \(H_f(v)\):

\[
f(x) \approx f(v) + \nabla f(v)^T (x - v) + \frac{1}{2} (x - v)^T H_f(v) (x - v)
\]

Here, the Hessian is a \(d \times d\) matrix of second partial derivatives, analogous to the second derivative in one dimension. Quadratic approximations provide more accurate local approximations, especially useful in advanced optimization algorithms.

---

### Core Concepts

- **Gradient**: Vector of partial derivatives; computational and geometric interpretations.
- **Linear Approximation**: Locally approximating \(f\) by a linear function using the gradient.
- **Tangent Plane**: The graph of the linear approximation forms a plane tangent to the surface of \(f\).
- **Contour/Level Sets**: Sets where \(f\) is constant; the gradient is perpendicular to these sets.
- **Directional Derivative**: Rate of change of \(f\) in any direction; dot product of gradient and direction.
- **Steepest Ascent Direction**: Direction aligned with the gradient; maximizes increase in \(f\).
- **Descent Directions**: Directions where the directional derivative is negative; used in minimization.
- **Critical Points**: Points where the gradient is zero; candidates for minima, maxima, or saddle points.
- **Hessian Matrix**: Matrix of second derivatives; used in quadratic approximations.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q1: Why is the gradient perpendicular to the contour set?**  
A1: At any point on a contour (where the function value is constant), the function does not change in directions tangent to the contour. The gradient points in the direction of the greatest increase in function value, so it must be perpendicular to the contour to be orthogonal to all directions of no change.

**Q2: How does the directional derivative relate to the gradient?**  
A2: The directional derivative in direction \(u\) is the dot product of the gradient and \(u\), measuring how fast \(f\) changes as you move from the point in that direction.

**Q3: What is the significance of the gradient being zero?**  
A3: A zero gradient at a point indicates a critical point where the function might have a local minimum, maximum, or saddle point. It is a necessary condition for optimality in differentiable functions.

**Q4: What role does the Hessian play in optimization?**  
A4: The Hessian matrix captures curvature information of the function. It helps in determining the nature of critical points (minima, maxima, saddle) and is used in second-order optimization methods.

**Q5: How do you use the gradient to find the direction of steepest descent?**  
A5: The direction of steepest descent is the negative of the gradient vector, normalized to unit length.

### Notes

- ([00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ynm5oJRjxY&t=0s)) ### Summary of the Video Transcript: Four Fundamental Subspaces in Linear Algebra for Machine Learning

This lecture, part of a machine learning foundations course, focuses on an essential linear algebra topic: the four fundamental subspaces associated with any matrix. These subspaces are crucial in understanding the behavior of linear systems and their applications in machine learning. The video covers the column space, null space, row space, and left null space of a matrix, along with their properties, relationships, and how to compute them through examples.

---

### Introduction to the Four Fundamental Subspaces

The instructor begins by emphasizing the relevance of linear algebra in machine learning. The focus is on the four fundamental subspaces related to a matrix \( A \), which are:

1. **Column Space (C(A))**
2. **Null Space (N(A))**
3. **Row Space (R(A))**
4. **Left Null Space (N(A^T))**

These subspaces help describe solutions to systems of linear equations and reveal structural properties of matrices.

---

### 1. Column Space (C(A))

- **Definition:** The column space of a matrix \( A \) is the set (or span) of all linear combinations of the columns of \( A \).
- **Mathematical Representation:** If \( A \) has columns \( u_1, u_2, ..., u_n \), then
  \[
  C(A) = \text{span}\{u_1, u_2, ..., u_n\}.
  \]
- **Significance:** The column space directly relates to the solvability of the equation \( Ax = b \). For \( Ax = b \) to have a solution, the vector \( b \) must lie in the column space of \( A \).
- **Example:** Consider a matrix \( A \) with 4 rows and 3 columns (4 equations, 3 unknowns). The column space is a subspace of \( \mathbb{R}^4 \). Not all vectors in \( \mathbb{R}^4 \) belong to the column space, as demonstrated by the example where one column is a linear combination of two others, making the column space two-dimensional.

---

### 2. Null Space (N(A))

- **Definition:** The null space of \( A \) is the set of all vectors \( x \) such that \( Ax = 0 \).
- **Properties:**
  - It is a subspace because it is closed under vector addition and scalar multiplication.
  - If \( x_1, x_2 \in N(A) \), then \( A(x_1 + x_2) = 0 \), and for any scalar \( \alpha \), \( A(\alpha x_1) = 0 \).
- **Example:** Using the same matrix \( A \), one can find vectors \( x \) such that \( Ax = 0 \). For instance, if column 3 equals the sum of columns 1 and 2, then \( x = (1, 1, -1)^T \) belongs to the null space.
- **Dimensionality:** The null space is a subspace of \( \mathbb{R}^n \), where \( n \) is the number of columns of \( A \). In the example, the null space is a line (1-dimensional subspace) in \( \mathbb{R}^3 \).
- **Remarks:**
  - If \( A \) is invertible (square and full rank), the null space contains only the zero vector.
  - If \( A \) is not full rank, there exist non-trivial null space vectors, and general solutions to \( Ax = b \) can be expressed as \( x = x_p + x_n \), where \( x_p \) is a particular solution and \( x_n \in N(A) \).
- **Finding the Null Space:** Gaussian elimination can be used to solve \( Ax = 0 \). The process involves reducing \( A \) to row echelon form, identifying pivot and free variables, and expressing the null space vectors in terms of free variables.

---

### 3. Rank and Nullity

- **Rank:** The number of pivot columns in the row-reduced form of \( A \), also equal to the dimension of the column space.
- **Nullity:** The number of free variables in the system \( Ax = 0 \), equal to the dimension of the null space.
- **Rank-Nullity Theorem:** For an \( m \times n \) matrix \( A \),
  \[
  \text{rank}(A) + \text{nullity}(A) = n,
  \]
  where \( n \) is the number of columns of \( A \).
  
This fundamental theorem connects the structure of the matrix to its subspaces and is essential in understanding solutions to linear systems.

---

### 4. Row Space (R(A))

- **Definition:** The row space of \( A \) is the set of all linear combinations of the rows of \( A \).
- **Relation to Column Space of \( A^T \):**
  \[
  R(A) = C(A^T).
  \]
- **Dimension:** The dimension of the row space, called the row rank, equals the dimension of the column space (column rank). Hence,
  \[
  \text{rank}(A) = \text{row rank}(A) = \dim(R(A)) = \dim(C(A)).
  \]

This equality of row rank and column rank is a fundamental fact in linear algebra.

---

### 5. Left Null Space (N(A^T))

- **Definition:** The left null space is the null space of the transpose of \( A \), i.e., all vectors \( y \) such that
  \[
  A^T y = 0.
  \]
- **Interpretation:** It consists of all linear combinations of the rows of \( A \) that produce the zero vector.
- **Dimension Relationship:** Applying the rank-nullity theorem to \( A^T \) (which is \( n \times m \)) yields
  \[
  \text{rank}(A) + \dim(N(A^T)) = m,
  \]
  where \( m \) is the number of rows of \( A \).
- This means the dimension of the left null space is \( m - r \), where \( r \) is the rank of \( A \).

---

### Illustrative Example of the Four Subspaces

The instructor works through examples to illustrate these concepts:

- A matrix \( A \) and its Gaussian elimination steps are shown.
- The pivot columns define the rank, and the free variables define the nullity.
- Null space vectors are found by setting free variables to 1 and 0 alternately and solving for the pivot variables.
- The row space is identified as the column space of \( A^T \).
- The left null space is found by solving \( A^T y = 0 \), which corresponds to linear dependencies among the rows.

For example, a 2x2 matrix \( A = \begin{bmatrix}1 & 2 \\ 3 & 6\end{bmatrix} \) is analyzed:

- The second column is twice the first, so the column space is one-dimensional (line through \( (1,3) \)).
- Null space is the line through \( (-2,1) \).
- Row space is the line through \( (1,2) \) (the columns of \( A^T \)).
- Left null space is the line through \( (-3,1) \).

---

### Key Takeaways and Recap

- The four fundamental subspaces provide a comprehensive understanding of the matrix \( A \) and the linear system \( Ax = b \).
- Column space and null space relate to the columns and solutions of \( A \), while row space and left null space relate to the rows and the transpose matrix.
- Dimensions of these subspaces satisfy key relationships:
  - \( \dim(C(A)) + \dim(N(A)) = n \) (number of columns),
  - \( \dim(R(A)) + \dim(N(A^T)) = m \) (number of rows),
  - \( \dim(C(A)) = \dim(R(A)) = \text{rank}(A). \)
- Gaussian elimination is an essential tool for finding bases for these subspaces.
- Understanding these subspaces is fundamental for solving linear systems, analyzing matrix rank, and further topics in machine learning such as understanding the properties of data matrices, feature spaces, and model parameters.

---

### Final Remarks and Homework

The instructor encourages students to practice by computing the four fundamental subspaces for given matrices, using Gaussian elimination and understanding how to extract bases and dimensions. This hands-on approach reinforces the theoretical concepts and prepares students for more advanced machine learning topics that rely on linear algebra.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q1: Why are the four fundamental subspaces important in machine learning?**  
A1: They help understand the structure of data matrices, the solvability of linear systems, and the behavior of learning algorithms, particularly those based on linear models.

**Q2: How is the null space related to solutions of \( Ax = b \)?**  
A2: The null space contains all homogeneous solutions \( x_n \) such that \( Ax_n = 0 \). Any solution to \( Ax = b \) can be written as a particular solution plus an element from the null space, i.e., \( x = x_p + x_n \).

**Q3: What does the rank of a matrix tell us?**  
A3: Rank indicates the dimension of the column space (or row space) and corresponds to the number of linearly independent columns (or rows). It reflects the maximum number of independent constraints or features in the matrix.

**Q4: How do you find the left null space?**  
A4: The left null space is found by solving \( A^T y = 0 \), which means finding linear combinations of the rows of \( A \) that yield the zero vector.

This lecture, part of the Machine Learning Foundations course, focuses on the fundamental mathematical concepts of orthogonality and orthogonal subspaces. It serves as a crucial stepping stone toward understanding orthogonal projections and least squares problems, which are essential in many machine learning algorithms, especially those involving linear models and optimization.

---

### Introduction and Motivation

The lecturer begins by introducing the motivation behind studying orthogonality. Understanding when vectors or subspaces are orthogonal enables us to define and work with orthogonal projections, which in turn are critical for solving least squares problems. These projections help in minimizing errors in linear approximations, a central task in regression and many learning algorithms.

The lecture aims to:

1. Define orthogonality between vectors.
2. Extend this to orthogonality between subspaces.
3. Explore the fundamental subspaces associated with a matrix and their orthogonal relationships.
4. Prepare the ground for understanding projections in the next lecture.

---

### Core Concepts Covered

#### 1. Length (Norm) of a Vector

The lecture starts with a review of how to measure the length or magnitude of a vector \( \mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^n \). The length, or Euclidean norm, is defined as:

\[
\| \mathbf{x} \| = \sqrt{x_1^2 + x_2^2 + \dots + x_n^2}
\]

Example: For a vector \( \mathbf{x} = (1, 2) \), its length is \( \sqrt{1^2 + 2^2} = \sqrt{5} \).

This concept is foundational because it relates directly to the geometric interpretation of vectors and angles between them.

#### 2. Orthogonality Between Vectors

Two vectors \( \mathbf{x} \) and \( \mathbf{y} \) are orthogonal if their dot product (inner product) is zero:

\[
\mathbf{x}^T \mathbf{y} = \sum_{i=1}^n x_i y_i = 0
\]

This algebraic condition corresponds to the geometric notion of vectors being perpendicular, analogous to the right angle in the Pythagorean theorem. The lecture revisits the Pythagorean theorem to illustrate how if vectors \( \mathbf{x} \) and \( \mathbf{y} \) satisfy

\[
\|\mathbf{x} + \mathbf{y}\|^2 = \|\mathbf{x}\|^2 + \|\mathbf{y}\|^2,
\]

then they must be orthogonal, since the cross terms vanish due to \( \mathbf{x}^T \mathbf{y} = 0 \).

Two important remarks are made:

- The zero vector \( \mathbf{0} \) is orthogonal to every vector.
- A set of mutually orthogonal vectors (none of which is zero) is linearly independent. This is shown by taking dot products and using the mutual orthogonality to isolate coefficients, proving each must be zero if their linear combination sums to zero.

---

#### 3. Orthonormal Vectors

An orthonormal set of vectors is a set where the vectors are both orthogonal and of unit length (norm 1).

Examples given include:

- The standard basis vectors, e.g., \( (1,0), (0,1) \).
- Rotated basis vectors like \( (\cos \theta, \sin \theta) \) and \( (-\sin \theta, \cos \theta) \).

Orthonormality is a stronger condition than orthogonality and is very useful in simplifying projections and transformations.

---

#### 4. Orthogonal Subspaces

The lecture generalizes orthogonality from vectors to subspaces. Two subspaces \( U \) and \( V \) are orthogonal if every vector in \( U \) is orthogonal to every vector in \( V \):

\[
\forall \mathbf{x} \in U, \forall \mathbf{y} \in V, \quad \mathbf{x}^T \mathbf{y} = 0.
\]

Examples illustrate trivial orthogonality: the zero vector is orthogonal to any subspace. More complex examples involve subspaces defined as spans of particular vectors.

---

#### 5. Orthogonality Among the Four Fundamental Subspaces

A key part of the lecture is the exploration of orthogonality relationships among the four fundamental subspaces associated with a matrix \( A \):

- **Column space** \( C(A) \)
- **Null space** \( N(A) \)
- **Row space** \( R(A) \)
- **Left null space** \( N(A^T) \)

Two main claims are established and proven:

- The row space of \( A \) is orthogonal to the null space of \( A \).
  
  Proof Sketch: If \( \mathbf{x} \in N(A) \), then \( A \mathbf{x} = \mathbf{0} \). Writing \( A \) in terms of its rows, this implies each row vector \( \mathbf{r}_i \) satisfies \( \mathbf{r}_i^T \mathbf{x} = 0 \), meaning \( \mathbf{x} \) is orthogonal to every row vector. Since the row space is spanned by these row vectors, it follows that the entire row space is orthogonal to the null space.

- The column space of \( A \) is orthogonal to the null space of \( A^T \).

  This follows from the first claim by considering the transpose of \( A \).

The lecturer also notes these orthogonality relations can be used for dimension checks and have important implications in linear algebra and machine learning.

---

### Illustrative Example

A concrete example is provided with matrix \( A \) whose second column is twice the first. From this:

- The column space \( C(A) \) is one-dimensional (span of first column).
- The null space \( N(A) \) consists of vectors \( \mathbf{x} \) such that \( A \mathbf{x} = \mathbf{0} \), for example \( (-2, 1)^T \).
- The row space \( R(A) \) is the span of the first row since others are scalar multiples.
- The null space \( N(A^T) \) is the set of vectors orthogonal to the column space.

Dot products between vectors from row space and null space yield zero, verifying orthogonality. Similarly, column space and left null space are orthogonal.

Dimension checks confirm these orthogonality relations align with the rank-nullity theorem and the structure of the matrix.

---

### Summary and Outlook

To conclude, the lecture recaps the key takeaways:

- The length of vectors and the definition of orthogonality.
- The concept of orthonormality.
- Orthogonality extended to subspaces.
- Orthogonality relations between the four fundamental subspaces of a matrix, especially:
  - Row space âŠ¥ Null space

### Notes

This lecture, part of the "Machine Learning Foundations" series, delves deeply into the concept of **projections in linear algebra**, emphasizing their critical role in solving least squares problems. The discussion begins with the motivation behind projections, particularly in contexts where linear systems of equations are inconsistentâ€”meaning the system has no exact solution because the target vector lies outside the column space of the matrix representing the system.

The instructor introduces projections starting with the simplest case: projecting a vector onto a line. This foundational case helps build intuition for more complex projections onto subspaces, such as the column space of a matrix, which will be covered in subsequent lectures. The lecture also connects this geometric notion of projection to algebraic formulations, showing how to compute the projection efficiently using matrix operations.

A significant highlight is the derivation of the **projection formula** onto a line spanned by a vector \( a \), which leads to the concept of the **projection matrix** \( P \). The projection matrix has important properties such as being symmetric and idempotent (\( P^2 = P \)), which are explained both algebraically and intuitively.

In addition, the lecture provides a concise proof of the **Cauchy-Schwarz inequality** using the concept of projection, demonstrating the broad applicability and significance of projections in linear algebra and machine learning.

The lecture concludes with a summary reiterating the importance of projections for solving inconsistent systems through least squares approximations and foreshadows the next lecture, which will generalize projections from lines to subspaces, specifically the column space of a matrix, and apply these ideas to least squares problems.

---

### Highlights

- **Motivation for projections:** Addressing inconsistent linear systems where \( Ax = b \) cannot be solved exactly because \( b \) is not in the column space of \( A \).
- **Projection onto a line:** Geometric and algebraic understanding of projecting a vector \( b \) onto a line spanned by a vector \( a \).
- **Projection formula:** \( p = \hat{x}a \), where \( \hat{x} = \frac{a^T b}{a^T a} \).
- **Projection matrix:** Defined as \( P = \frac{a a^T}{a^T a} \), allowing projection of any vector \( b \) via matrix multiplication \( Pb \).
- **Properties of the projection matrix:**
  - Symmetric: \( P = P^T \).
  - Idempotent: \( P^2 = P \).
  - Column space: The line spanned by \( a \).
  - Null space: The space orthogonal to \( a \).
- **Example:** Projection matrix for vector \( a = (1,1,1)^T \) results in a matrix with all entries equal to \( \frac{1}{3} \).
- **Cauchy-Schwarz inequality:** Proven succinctly via projection concepts.
- **Connection to least squares:** Projection onto the column space of \( A \) is the geometric interpretation of solving least squares problems.
- **Next steps:** Extending projections from lines to subspaces and applying these concepts to least squares solutions.

---

### Key Insights

1. **Why projections matter:**
   - Many real-world data or systems generate inconsistent linear equations.
   - When no exact solution exists, the next best approach is to find an approximate solution by projecting the target vector onto the closest point in the column space.
   - This approximate solution minimizes the error in a least squares sense.

2. **Geometric intuition of projection:**
   - The projection \( p \) of \( b \) onto a line through \( a \) is the closest vector on that line to \( b \).
   - The error vector \( e = b - p \) is orthogonal to \( a \).
   - This orthogonality condition leads directly to the formula for \( \hat{x} \).

3. **Algebraic formulation via projection matrix:**
   - The projection can be expressed as a matrix multiplication \( P b \).
   - \( P \) depends only on \( a \) and encapsulates the projection operation for any vector \( b \).
   - The matrix \( P \) is symmetric and idempotent, reflecting the geometric properties of projection.

4. **Properties of the projection matrix:**
   - **Symmetry** ensures that the projection is an orthogonal projection.
   - **Idempotency** means applying the projection multiple times does not change the result after the first projection.
   - The **column space** of \( P \) is exactly the line onto which vectors are projected.
   - The **null space** corresponds to vectors orthogonal to \( a \).

5. **Scaling invariance of the projection matrix:**
   - Changing \( a \) by a scalar factor (e.g., from \( (1,1,1)^T \) to \( (2,2,2)^T \)) does not change the projection matrix.
   - This indicates that the projection depends only on the subspace spanned by \( a \), not the particular vector used.

6. **Cauchy-Schwarz inequality via projection:**
   - The inequality \( |a^T b| \leq \|a\|\|b\| \) is shown by considering the length of the error vector \( e \), which must be non-negative.
   - This proof highlights the power of geometric reasoning in linear algebra.

7. **Link to least squares:**
   - Least squares solutions seek to minimize \( \|Ax - b\|^2 \), the squared distance between \( b \) and the column space of \( A \).
   - This is equivalent to projecting \( b \) onto that subspace.
   - Understanding projections onto lines sets the stage for understanding projections onto higher-dimensional subspaces.
