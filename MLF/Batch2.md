This video lecture provides a detailed introduction to the concept of density estimation within the broader field of unsupervised learning. It builds on the previous topic of dimensionality reduction and focuses on probabilistic modeling, explaining how density estimation algorithms are used to assign probability scores to data points and generate models that represent the underlying distribution of data. The lecture uses concrete examples, mathematical formulations, and intuitive explanations to clarify the goals, challenges, and approaches in density estimation, finishing with a brief overview of the course’s future direction.

### Introduction to Density Estimation

Density estimation is a fundamental problem in unsupervised learning where the goal is to learn a probabilistic model that assigns likelihood scores to different configurations or instances of data. Unlike supervised learning, where the goal is to predict labels, density estimation focuses on understanding the distribution of the data itself.

A probabilistic model produced by a density estimation algorithm can evaluate how likely any given data point is to have been generated by the underlying data source. For example, the video discusses a scenario involving Twitter data: a robot account that generates tweets indistinguishable from those of a real user. Such models can score any possible tweet, assessing how likely it is to have come from the original user by assigning a probability to each tweet.

---

### Probabilistic Models and Their Role

The output of a density estimation process is a probabilistic model \( P \) that maps data points \( x \) from their input space (such as the space of tweets or other forms of data) to positive real numbers representing probabilities. A key property of such models is that the sum of probabilities over all possible data points must equal 1, ensuring that the model is a valid probability distribution.

For instance, if a tweet is represented as a sequence of 128 characters, and each character can be one of 26 lowercase letters (or possibly 27 including a space), the space of all possible tweets is enormous—\( 26^{128} \) possible tweets. The model must assign a probability to every potential tweet such that the probabilities sum to 1.

---

### Mathematical Formulation of Density Estimation

The goal is to learn a function \( P: \mathbb{R}^d \to \mathbb{R}^+ \) that assigns probabilities to each possible data point in a \( d \)-dimensional space, where \( d \) is the dimensionality of the data. The sum (or integral, in the case of continuous variables) of \( P(x) \) over all \( x \) must be 1.

The learning algorithm receives a dataset consisting of \( n \) samples \( \{x_1, x_2, ..., x_n\} \) drawn from the underlying distribution. The objective is to find a probability distribution \( P \) that assigns high probabilities to data points that resemble the training data, and low probabilities elsewhere.

To quantify how well a model fits the data, the negative log likelihood (NLL) is commonly used as a loss function. Specifically, for each data point \( x_i \), the model aims to maximize \( P(x_i) \), or equivalently minimize \( -\log P(x_i) \). The average negative log likelihood over the dataset is minimized to find the best model.

---

### Examples of Density Estimation Models

#### Example 1: Uniform Distributions on the Real Line

A simple illustrative example is presented where the data is one-dimensional, consisting of four data points \( x_1=2.3 \), \( x_2=2.7 \), \( x_3=4.6 \), \( x_4=4.9 \).

Three candidate models are considered:

- \( P_1(x) \): Uniform distribution over the interval \([0, 10]\), with density \( \frac{1}{10} \) if \( x \in [0,10] \), zero otherwise.
- \( P_2(x) \): Uniform distribution over the interval \([0, 5]\), with density \( \frac{1}{5} \) if \( x \in [0,5] \), zero otherwise.
- \( P_3(x) \): Uniform distribution over the interval \([3, 8]\), with density \( \frac{1}{5} \) if \( x \in [3,8] \), zero otherwise.

The negative log likelihood is computed for each model on the four data points:

- For \( P_1 \), since all data points lie between 0 and 10, the probability for each is \( \frac{1}{10} \).
- For \( P_2 \), all points also lie between 0 and 5, so the probability for each is \( \frac{1}{5} \).
- For \( P_3 \), two points (2.3 and 2.7) lie outside the interval [3,8], so their probabilities are zero, meaning the negative log likelihood is infinite.

Because \( P_3 \) assigns zero probability to some data points, it is rejected. Between \( P_1 \) and \( P_2 \), \( P_2 \) assigns higher probabilities (due to the smaller interval), resulting in a lower negative log likelihood and hence a better fit to the data.

This example illustrates how the choice of model impacts the likelihood score and highlights the importance of selecting models that cover the data well without overly broad distributions.

---

### Example 2: Gaussian Mixture Models for Multidimensional Data

The video then discusses a more complex example involving nine data points in two dimensions, visualized as points on a Cartesian plane.

Two Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) are proposed as candidate models for the data:

- Model \( P_1 \): Mixture of three Gaussian components centered near the clusters in the data, e.g., centers at \((0,0), (4,1), (7,3)\).
- Model \( P_2 \): Mixture of three Gaussians centered at points not matching the data clusters, e.g., \((5,5), (8,9), (-1,-2)\).

While the video does not compute exact likelihood values, it is clear that \( P_1 \) better captures the structure of the data since its centers are aligned with the observed clusters, while \( P_2 \) is less representative.

Again, the negative log likelihood would be lower for \( P_1 \), making it the preferred model for density estimation.

---

### Generalization and Model Selection

The video emphasizes that in real-world density estimation, one is not restricted to a small set of predefined candidate models (like \( P_1, P_2, P_3 \)). Instead, the learning algorithm explores an entire parametric family or an infinite class of models to find the one that minimizes the negative log likelihood.

This involves balancing model complexity and fit, often using tools from optimization, statistical inference, and machine learning theory to identify the best probabilistic representation of the data’s distribution.

---

### Extensions and Relation to Other Learning Problems

The lecture briefly touches upon the fact that density estimation, like regression, classification, and dimensionality reduction, encompasses various models and methods, including but not limited to uniform distributions and Gaussian mixtures.

The video concludes by situating density estimation alongside dimensionality reduction as two fundamental unsupervised learning tasks. It notes that later in the course, deeper treatments of these problems will be provided, including how to develop learning algorithms that find the best models from large or infinite model classes.

### Notes

- ([00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi9nUcrZAJs&t=0s)) ### Summary

The video covers foundational mathematical concepts essential for understanding machine learning, focusing primarily on calculus and related tools with a geometric and graphical emphasis. The content is structured to provide a solid grounding in sets, functions, metric and vector spaces, logic, sequences, and visualization techniques to prepare learners for more advanced material in the course.

---

### Introduction to Sets and Notation

The video begins by introducing the basic sets frequently used throughout the course. These include:

- **R:** The set of all real numbers.
- **R⁺:** The set of all non-negative real numbers (including zero).
- **Z:** The set of integers.
- **Z⁺:** The set of non-negative integers (including zero).
  
Additionally, intervals are discussed:

- **Closed interval [a, b]:** Includes all real numbers between a and b, including the endpoints a and b.
- **Open interval (a, b):** Includes all real numbers between a and b, excluding the endpoints.

These sets can be extended to higher dimensions via Cartesian products. For example, **Rᵈ** denotes the set of d-dimensional real vectors, which is equivalent to R × R × ... × R (d times). Similarly, intervals can be extended to their d-dimensional counterparts, where each coordinate lies within a specified interval.

---

### Metric Spaces and Distance Functions

Next, the concept of a **metric space** is introduced, which is essentially a set equipped with a distance function (metric). The primary metric used in the course is the **Euclidean distance** on Rᵈ, defined as:

\[ d(x, y) = \|x - y\| = \sqrt{(x_1 - y_1)^2 + \ldots + (x_d - y_d)^2} \]

where \(x, y \in R^d\).

A key concept related to metric spaces is the **ball**:

- **Open ball** \(B(x, \epsilon)\): The set of points within a radius \(\epsilon\) of a center point \(x\), excluding the boundary.
- **Closed ball** \(\bar{B}(x, \epsilon)\): The set of points within or on the radius \(\epsilon\) of \(x\), including the boundary.

This distinction between open and closed balls is illustrated in two-dimensional space, emphasizing their importance in analysis and topology within metric spaces.

---

### Set Operations and Logic

The video then revisits basic set operations and logic with a focus on Venn diagrams and De Morgan’s laws:

- **Union (A ∪ B):** Elements in either set A or B.
- **Intersection (A ∩ B):** Elements common to both sets.
- **Complement (Aᶜ):** Elements not in A but in the universe \(V\).
- **Set difference (V \ A):** Equivalent to the complement of A.

De Morgan’s laws are highlighted:

1. \((A ∪ B)^c = A^c ∩ B^c\)
2. \((A ∩ B)^c = A^c ∪ B^c\)

These laws are visually and algebraically verified using examples with intervals on the real line, reinforcing the fundamental logic required for set theory and mathematical reasoning.

---

### Logical Quantifiers and Implications

The video introduces key logical quantifiers and implication symbols:

- **∀ (For all):** Universal quantifier.
- **∃ (There exists):** Existential quantifier.
- **→ (Implies):** Logical implication.
- **↔ (If and only if):** Logical equivalence.

These logical tools are essential for formal mathematical statements in analysis and calculus.

---

### Sequences and Convergence

Sequences, defined as ordered collections of elements (often vectors), serve as a foundational concept. Two example sequences in R² illustrate convergent and non-convergent behavior:

1. **Convergent sequence:** \(x_n = (1 + \frac{4}{2^n}, 3 - \frac{4}{2^n})\) approaches the point (1, 3) as \(n \to \infty\).
2. **Non-convergent sequence:** \(x_n = (\cos(\frac{\pi}{2} n), \sin(\frac{\pi}{2} n))\) oscillates without settling to a limit.

The formal definition of convergence in a metric space is provided:

A sequence \(\{x_n\}\) converges to \(x^*\) if for every \(\epsilon > 0\), there exists an \(N\) such that for all \(n \geq N\), \(x_n\) lies within the open ball \(B(x^*, \epsilon)\).

Graphical intuition is given, showing how the convergent sequence eventually stays inside any arbitrarily small ball around the limit point, whereas the non-convergent sequence does not.

---

### Vector Spaces and Linear Combinations

The concept of a **vector space** is introduced as a set of vectors closed under linear combinations:

\[
\text{If } u, v \in V \text{ and } \alpha, \beta \in \mathbb{R}, \text{ then } \alpha u + \beta v \in V.
\]

The primary example is \(R^d\), which naturally satisfies this property. Other vector space properties exist but are not detailed, emphasizing the importance of closure under linear combinations.

The video also covers the **dot product** (inner product) in vector spaces:

\[
x \cdot y = x^T y = \sum_{i=1}^d x_i y_i,
\]

and the associated **norm**:

\[
\|x\|^2 = x \cdot x = \sum_{i=1}^d x_i^2.
\]

Orthogonality (perpendicularity) is defined as two vectors \(x, y\) being orthogonal if their dot product is zero:

\[
x \cdot y = 0.
\]

These concepts are crucial for understanding geometric relationships in vector spaces.

---

### Functions and Their Visualization

Functions are mappings from one set (domain) to another (codomain):

\[
f: A \to B,
\]

where \(A\) and \(B\) are sets. The domain and codomain are clarified, with special attention to real-valued functions where the codomain is \(R\).

- **One-dimensional function:** \(f: R \to R\).
- **Multivariate function:** \(f: R^d \to R\).

The **graph of a function** is defined as:

\[
G_f = \{ (x, f(x)) \mid x \in R^d \} \subseteq R^{d+1}.
\]

Visualizing functions is straightforward for one-dimensional functions (plots on 2D planes), but more challenging for higher dimensions.

---

### Visualization of Two-Dimensional Functions: Contour and Heat Maps

For functions \(f: R^2 \to R\), visualization requires techniques beyond simple plots:

- **Contour plots:** Lines (contours) representing points where the function has constant values. For example, \(f(x) = x_1 + x_2\) can be visualized by plotting lines where \(f(x) = c\) for various constants \(c\).

Contours resemble geographic isotherms or isobars, indicating levels of equal value.

- **Heat maps:** Colored maps where colors represent function values continuously across the domain. Heat maps provide richer information by showing smooth gradients but may obscure geometric shapes of individual contours.

Examples include:

- \(f(x) = x_1 x_2\), where contour lines form hyperbolas.
- \(f(x) = x_1^2 + x_2^2\), where contours are concentric circles, and the heat map is circularly symmetric.

The video explains how increasing the number of contours or adjusting color scales can enhance visualization.

---

### Conclusion

The video concludes by summarizing the key mathematical tools and visualization techniques introduced. These foundational elements—sets, metric and vector spaces, logic, sequences, and function visualization—form the backbone of the calculus and machine learning concepts to be explored later in the course. Mastery of these basics will enable learners to tackle more complex analytical challenges in machine learning with confidence.

- URL:<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvaPORg2w9c>

### Notes

- ([00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvaPORg2w9c&t=0s)) ### Summary

This lecture provides a foundational review of univariate calculus concepts essential for understanding machine learning. It focuses primarily on the notions of continuity and differentiability of real-valued functions from \(\mathbb{R}\) to \(\mathbb{R}\). The lecture revisits the formal definitions, offers illustrative examples, and explores the relationship between continuity and differentiability, preparing students for later modules involving derivatives and linear approximations.

---

### Continuity of Functions

The lecture begins with a formal definition of continuity for a real-valued function \(f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}\). A function \(f\) is said to be continuous at a point \(x^*\) if for every sequence \((x_i)\) converging to \(x^*\), the corresponding function values \(f(x_i)\) converge to \(f(x^*)\). In other words:

\[
\lim_{x \to x^*} f(x) = f(x^*)
\]

This definition ensures that as inputs approach \(x^*\), the function values smoothly approach the function's value at \(x^*\), with no sudden jumps or breaks.

**Example 1: Continuous Function**

The function \(f(x) = x^2\) is continuous at \(x^* = 2\). To verify this, consider a sequence \(x_i\) such as \(3, 2.5, 2.25, \ldots\), which converges to 2. The corresponding function values \(f(x_i) = x_i^2\) produce a sequence \(9, 6.25, 5.0625, \ldots\), which converges to \(4 = f(2)\). This confirms continuity at \(x = 2\). More broadly, \(f(x) = x^2\) is continuous for all \(x \in \mathbb{R}\).

**Example 2: Discontinuous Function**

The sign function, defined as:

\[
f(x) = \begin{cases}
-1 & \text{if } x < 0 \\
0 & \text{if } x = 0 \\
1 & \text{if } x > 0
\end{cases}
\]

is discontinuous at \(x^* = 0\). Two sequences are considered here, both converging to 0: \(x_i = 1, \frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{4}, \ldots\) and \(x_i = -1, -\frac{1}{2}, -\frac{1}{4}, \ldots\). The function values for the first sequence are all 1, converging to 1, while for the second sequence, the values are all \(-1\), converging to \(-1\). Since these two limits differ and neither equals \(f(0) = 0\), the function is not continuous at 0.

**Additional Examples**

- A piecewise function \(f(x) = 2x + 1\) for \(x > 1\) and \(3\) for \(x \leq 1\) can be continuous, depending on the values at the boundary.
- The function \(f(x) = \frac{1}{x}\) is not continuous at \(x = 0\) because it is undefined there. Even sequences approaching 0 from the positive side produce function values that diverge to infinity.
- \(f(x) = \sin\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)\) is discontinuous at zero. Sequences approaching zero yield wildly oscillating function values, preventing a well-defined limit.

The lecture emphasizes that a function is continuous if it is continuous at every point in its domain.

---

### Differentiability of Functions

Moving from continuity, the lecture introduces the concept of differentiability. A function \(f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}\) is differentiable at a point \(x^*\) if the following limit exists:

\[
\lim_{x \to x^*} \frac{f(x) - f(x^*)}{x - x^*}
\]

If this limit exists, it is defined as the derivative of \(f\) at \(x^*\), denoted \(f'(x^*)\).

**Key Relationship Between Continuity and Differentiability**

- If \(f\) is not continuous at \(x^*\), it cannot be differentiable at \(x^*\).
- However, the converse is not true: a function can be continuous but not differentiable at a point.

**Example: Continuous but Not Differentiable**

The absolute value function \(f(x) = |x|\) is continuous everywhere but not differentiable at \(x^* = 0\). To see why, consider two sequences:

- \(x_i = 1, \frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{4}, \ldots\) approaching 0 from the right.
- \(x_i = -1, -\frac{1}{2}, -\frac{1}{4}, \ldots\) approaching 0 from the left.

Calculating the difference quotient:

\[
\frac{f(x_i) - f(0)}{x_i - 0} = \frac{|x_i| - 0}{x_i} =
\begin{cases}
1 & \text{for } x_i > 0 \\
-1 & \text{for } x_i < 0
\end{cases}
\]

Since the limits from the left and right differ, the derivative at 0 does not exist.

**Example: Non-Differentiable at a Point Due to Discontinuity**

For the piecewise function:

\[
f(x) = \begin{cases}
4x + 2 & x \geq 2 \\
2x + 8 & x < 2
\end{cases}
\]

The function is not continuous at \(x = 2\) because the limits from the left and right differ (\(12\) from left, \(10\) from right). Therefore, it is also not differentiable at \(x = 2\).

**Example: Continuous but Not Differentiable at a Point**

Consider:

\[
f(x) = \begin{cases}
4x + 2 & x \geq 2 \\
2x + 6 & x < 2
\end{cases}
\]

This function is continuous at \(x = 2\) since both sides approach the same value. However, the derivative from the right is 4, and from the left is 2, so the derivative does not exist at \(x = 2\).

---

### Intuition and Interpretation of the Derivative

The lecture offers an intuitive geometric interpretation of the derivative as the slope of the tangent line to the curve at a point.

The derivative at \(x^*\) can be expressed as:

\[
f'(x^*) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x^* + h) - f(x^*)}{h}
\]

This limit represents the slope of the secant line connecting \((x^*, f(x^*))\) and \((x^*+ h, f(x^* + h))\) as \(h\) approaches zero. As \(h\) decreases, the secant line approaches the tangent line at \(x^*\), and the slope of this tangent line is the derivative.

The lecture describes this visually: When \(h=1\), the secant line can be quite different from the curve; as \(h\) becomes smaller (e.g., \(h = \frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{4}, \ldots\)), the secant line better approximates the curve near \(x^*\). In the limit as \(h \to 0\), the difference disappears, and the derivative equals the slope of this tangent.

This interpretation connects the concept of the derivative to linear approximations of functions, which will be explored in subsequent modules.

---

### Key Insights

- **Continuity** means no sudden jumps or breaks in function values at a point.
- **Differentiability** requires a function to be smooth enough to have a well-defined slope at a point.
- Differentiability implies continuity, but continuity does not imply differentiability.
- Piecewise functions may be continuous but not differentiable at boundary points.
- Functions with oscillatory behavior near a point (like \(\sin(1/x)\) near zero) can be discontinuous.
- The derivative can be understood as the slope of the tangent line, capturing the instantaneous rate of change.
- The limit definition of the derivative can be approached via sequences converging to the point or via the limit as \(h \to 0\).

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q1: Why is continuity important before differentiability?**  
A1: A function must be continuous at a point to have a derivative there. If the function jumps or has gaps, the slope cannot be defined.

**Q2: Can a function be continuous everywhere but not differentiable anywhere?**  
A2: Yes, examples exist such as the Weierstrass function, which is continuous everywhere but nowhere differentiable. The lecture focused on simpler examples like the absolute value function.

**Q3: What is the geometric meaning of the derivative?**  
A3: The derivative at a point is the slope of the tangent line to the curve at that point, representing the instantaneous rate of change.

**Q4: How do piecewise functions affect continuity and differentiability?**  
A4: At points where the function definition changes, continuity and differentiability need to be verified by comparing limits from both sides.

**Q5: Why is \(f(x) = \sin(1/x)\) discontinuous at zero?**  
A5: Because as \(x\) approaches zero, \(\sin(1/x)\) oscillates infinitely often and does not settle on a single value.

This lecture focuses on the fundamental concepts of derivatives and linear approximations in the context of univariate calculus, which are foundational for understanding machine learning. The core idea is the derivative's definition and its use in approximating functions locally through linear approximations, which are crucial for optimization and analysis in machine learning algorithms.

---

### Core Concepts

1. **Derivative Definition**  
   The derivative of a function \( f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R} \) at a point \( x^*\) is defined as:  
   \[
   f'(x^*) = \lim_{x \to x^*} \frac{f(x) - f(x^*)}{x - x^*}
   \]
   This limit expresses the instantaneous rate of change of the function at \( x^* \).

2. **Linear Approximation**  
   When \( x \) is close to \( x^*\), the function \( f(x) \) can be approximated by a linear function:
   \[
   f(x) \approx f(x^*) + f'(x^*)(x - x^*)
   \]
   This is valid only near \( x = x^*\). The right-hand side is called the linear approximation or the first-order Taylor expansion around \( x^* \).

3. **Interpretation of Linear Approximation**  
   - The linear approximation \( L_{x^*}f(x) = f(x^*) + f'(x^*)(x - x^*) \) is a function of \( x \) with constants \( f(x^*) \) and \( f'(x^*) \).
   - Graphically, this linear approximation corresponds to the tangent line to the curve \( y = f(x) \) at the point \( (x^*, f(x^*)) \).
   - The tangent line "touches" the function graph at \( x^* \) and closely follows its behavior near that point.

4. **Graphical Illustration Using \( f(x) = x^2 \)**  
   - Choose \( x^* = 1 \).
   - \( f(1) = 1^2 = 1 \).
   - \( f'(x) = 2x \), so \( f'(1) = 2 \).
   - Linear approximation:
     \[
     L_1 f(x) = 1 + 2(x - 1) = 2x - 1
     \]
   - The tangent line \( y = 2x - 1 \) approximates the parabola \( y = x^2 \) near \( x = 1 \).
   - The approximation is exact at \( x = 1 \) but becomes less accurate as \( x \) moves away.

5. **Why Linear Approximation is Linear**  
   The linear approximation is a first-degree polynomial in \( x \), consisting of a constant term and a term linear in \( x \). This linearity arises from the constant derivative \( f'(x^*) \) and fixed base point \( f(x^*) \).

6. **Tangent Lines and Linear Approximations**  
   - The tangent line is a geometric concept: a line that touches the curve at exactly one point without crossing it locally.
   - The linear approximation is a functional concept: a linear function approximating \( f \) near \( x^* \).
   - The graph of the linear approximation function serves as the tangent line to the graph of \( f \) at \( (x^*, f(x^*)) \).

### Classic Examples of Linear Approximation

1. **\( f(x) = \sin x \) around \( x^* = 0 \)**  
   - \( f(0) = 0 \),  
   - \( f'(x) = \cos x \), so \( f'(0) = 1 \),  
   - Approximation:
     \[
     \sin x \approx 0 + 1 \cdot (x - 0) = x
     \]
   - This is the well-known small-angle approximation: \( \sin x \approx x \) for \( x \approx 0 \).

2. **\( f(x) = e^x \) around \( x^* = 0 \)**  
   - \( f(0) = 1 \),  
   - \( f'(x) = e^x \), so \( f'(0) = 1 \),  
   - Approximation:
     \[
     e^x \approx 1 + x
     \]
   - Valid for \( x \) near zero, this linearizes the exponential function for small inputs.

3. **\( f(x) = \log(1+x) \) around \( x^* = 0 \)**  
   - \( f(0) = \log 1 = 0 \),  
   - \( f'(x) = \frac{1}{1+x} \), so \( f'(0) = 1 \),  
   - Approximation:
     \[
     \log(1+x) \approx x
     \]
   - Useful for logarithms of values near 1.

4. **\( f(x) = (1+x)^r \) around \( x^* = 0 \), where \( r \) is an integer**  
   - \( f(0) = 1 \),  
   - \( f'(x) = r(1+x)^{r-1} \), so \( f'(0) = r \),  
   - Approximation:
     \[
     (1+x)^r \approx 1 + r x
     \]
   - This approximation simplifies powers of expressions close to 1.

---

### Practical Application Example

- **Approximating \( 0.99^7 \)**  
  The goal is to find which among given options (0.95, 0.93, 0.91, 0.9) is closest to \( 0.99^7 \).

- Using the linear approximation for \( (1+x)^r \) with \( r=7 \) and \( x = -0.01 \) (since \( 0.99 = 1 - 0.01 \)):
  \[
  (1 - 0.01)^7 \approx 1 + 7 \times (-0.01) = 1 - 0.07 = 0.93
  \]

- Therefore, \( 0.93 \) is the closest approximation.

- Intuition: This corresponds to a 1% decay compounded over 7 periods. The linear approximation treats this as a simple 7% loss, ignoring compound effects, which is valid for small rates and short periods.

---

### Importance in Machine Learning

- Linear approximations are powerful because they replace complex nonlinear functions with simple linear functions locally.
- This simplification makes optimization problems tractable, especially when dealing with gradients and updates in algorithms such as gradient descent.
- Understanding the nuances of when linear approximations hold (close to \( x^*\)) and when they break down (far from \( x^* \)) is critical for designing robust machine learning models.

---

### Limitations and Cautions

- Linear approximations are valid only near \( x^* \). As \( x \) moves further away, the approximation error grows.
- For large deviations or large rates (e.g., 10% loss instead of 1%), linear approximations become inaccurate.
- It is important to be aware of the domain of validity to avoid misleading conclusions.

---

### Key Insights

### Notes

- ([00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=En15LA59Fsw&t=0s)) ### Summary

This video lecture provides a comprehensive exploration of key concepts in univariate calculus, particularly focusing on linear and higher-order approximations, and their applications in differentiation rules and optimization. The discussion begins with the motivation behind linear approximations, extends to quadratic and higher-order approximations, then derives fundamental calculus rules such as the product and chain rules using linear approximation ideas. The lecture concludes with an important application of calculus in identifying critical points—maxima, minima, and saddle points—and their significance in optimization problems, especially in machine learning contexts.

---

### Introduction to Approximations

The video opens by addressing the fundamental question: Why are linear approximations important? Linear approximations involve approximating a function \( f(x) \) near a point \( x^*\) using a linear function based on the function's value and its first derivative at \( x^* \). Though linear functions themselves are simple, the power of this method lies in its ability to locally approximate complex functions using just the first derivative.

However, the lecturer points out that linear approximations are just the first step—higher-order approximations can be more accurate. For example, the quadratic approximation includes not only the function's value and first derivative at \( x^*\), but also the second derivative, adding a term proportional to \( (x - x^*)^2 \). This is known as the Taylor series expansion truncated at the quadratic term.

Using examples, the lecturer illustrates these concepts:

- For a quadratic function like \( f(x) = x^2 \), the quadratic approximation is exact because the function itself is a polynomial of degree two.
- For functions like \( e^x \), the quadratic approximation around \( x=0 \) is \( 1 + x + \frac{x^2}{2} \), which approximates \( e^x \) by truncating its Taylor series at the second term.

The lecturer emphasizes that while one can theoretically extend approximations to cubic, quartic, or even higher terms, in practical machine learning applications, linear and occasionally quadratic approximations suffice. Going beyond quadratic approximations is rarely used due to computational complexity and diminishing returns.

---

### Practical Example: Compound Interest Approximation

To demonstrate the practical utility of quadratic approximations, the lecturer presents a problem: estimating \( 1.1^7 \), which corresponds to applying a 10% growth rate over 7 years. Using a linear approximation (simple interest), the estimate is \( 1 + 7 \times 0.1 = 1.7 \). However, the true compound interest value is higher.

Calculating via the quadratic approximation yields:

\[
f(x) = (1 + x)^7, \quad f'(x) = 7(1 + x)^6, \quad f''(x) = 42(1 + x)^5
\]

Evaluating at \( x=0 \) and approximating for \( x=0.1 \):

\[
f(0.1) \approx 1 + 7 \times 0.1 + \frac{1}{2} \times 42 \times (0.1)^2 = 1 + 0.7 + 0.21 = 1.91
\]

This result is much closer to the actual compound interest than the linear approximation, demonstrating how quadratic terms capture non-linear growth effects.

---

### Deriving the Product Rule via Linear Approximation

Next, the lecturer revisits the product rule for derivatives, but from a novel perspective: linear approximations. Consider a function:

\[
f(x) = g(x) \times h(x)
\]

The goal is to find \( f'(x) \). Using linear approximations of \( g \) and \( h \) around \( x = 0 \):

\[
g(x) \approx g(0) + x g'(0), \quad h(x) \approx h(0) + x h'(0)
\]

Multiplying these, one obtains:

\[
f(x) \approx g(0) h(0) + x [g'(0) h(0) + g(0) h'(0)] + x^2 g'(0) h'(0)
\]

Ignoring the \( x^2 \) term (higher-order), the linear term's coefficient is the derivative at zero:

\[
f'(0) = g'(0) h(0) + g(0) h'(0)
\]

This matches the classical product rule. This approach intuitively shows that the product rule arises naturally when combining linear approximations and neglecting higher-order terms.

---

### Deriving the Chain Rule via Linear Approximation

The chain rule is similarly derived using linear approximations. For a composite function:

\[
f(x) = g(h(x))
\]

Approximate \( h(x) \) near \( x=0 \):

\[
h(x) \approx h(0) + x h'(0)
\]

Then approximate \( g(h(x)) \) near \( h(0) \):

\[
g(h(x)) \approx g(h(0)) + g'(h(0)) (h(x) - h(0)) \approx g(h(0)) + g'(h(0)) x h'(0)
\]

Matching this to the linear approximation of \( f(x) \):

\[
f(x) \approx f(0) + x f'(0)
\]

We identify:

\[
f'(0) = g'(h(0)) \times h'(0)
\]

This is the standard chain rule, derived here from the principles of linear approximations. The lecturer notes these are approximate equalities but are very accurate locally.

---

### Application: Computing Linear Approximations of Complex Functions

To illustrate the application of the product and chain rules, the lecturer considers a more complex function:

\[
f(x) = \frac{e^{3x}}{\sqrt{1 + x}}
\]

The goal is to find the linear approximation of \( f \) around \( x=0 \).

- Approximate \( e^{3x} \) as \( 1 + 3x \).
- Approximate \( (1 + x)^{-1/2} \) as \( 1 - \frac{x}{2} \).

Multiplying and ignoring the \( x^2 \) term:

\[
f(x) \approx (1 + 3x)(1 - \frac{x}{2}) = 1 + \frac{5}{2} x
\]

This matches the derivative calculation at zero, showing the practical convenience of combining linear approximations of components rather than differentiating the entire function at once.

---

### Linear Approximation Around Points Other Than Zero

The lecturer also emphasizes that approximations can be performed around any point \( x^* \), not just zero. For example, approximating \( e^{\sqrt{1+x}} \) around \( x=1 \) involves calculating \( f(1) \) and \( f'(1) \), and then expressing the linear approximation as:

\[
f(x) \approx f(1) + f'(1)(x - 1)
\]

This flexibility is important for practical scenarios where the point of interest is not zero.

---

### Maxima, Minima, and Saddle Points: Critical Points

The final topic covers critical points where the derivative \( f'(x^*) = 0 \). At such points, the linear approximation:

\[
L_x(f) = f(x^*) + f'(x^*)(x - x^*) = f(x^*)
\]

becomes a constant function, indicating no first-order variation near \( x^* \).

The lecturer explains that critical points are particularly important because they represent candidates for local maxima, minima, or saddle points:

- **Local minimum:** The function has a “valley” shape; the derivative is zero and the function value is lower than nearby points.
- **Local maximum:** The function has a “hill” shape; derivative zero and function value is higher than neighbors.
- **Saddle point:** The derivative is zero but the point is neither a maximum nor minimum; the function changes direction, resembling a saddle shape in higher dimensions.

Visual illustrations show examples of each case.

---

### Importance of Critical Points in Machine Learning

The lecturer highlights that machine learning problems fundamentally involve optimization—finding minima or maxima of objective functions. Hence, identifying critical points where the gradient (derivative) is zero is central to training models. The calculus principles discussed provide the theoretical foundation for optimization algorithms used in machine learning.

---

### Conclusion and Next Steps

The lecture concludes by summarizing the key role of linear approximations and their extensions in understanding calculus rules and optimization problems. With a solid understanding of univariate calculus, the course is set to move into multivariate calculus, extending these ideas to functions with multiple inputs.
